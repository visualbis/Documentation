Charts=============================================================================================With the VBX suite you receive a large set of additional charts, such asfunnel charts, gauges, and combination charts. In the following sectionswe will review the detailed functionality of the different chart types.Overview of VBX Charts----------------------Similar to the standard SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP LumiraDesigner chart components, the VBX chart extensions can be used as partof the application by a simple drag and drop from the VBX Chartscomponents pane (see Figure 4.1)... figure:: _static/images/Menu%20item.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.1: VBX Charts components panelList of VBX Chart Components----------------------------Based on the visualization type, the VBX chart components are groupedinto nine different categories.

In the following sections you can find detailedinformation about these features.Title and Subtitle~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The title is by default displayed at the top of the chart, and anoptional subtitle can be shown beneath it. The title and subtitle canalso be moved using the available settings in the Additional Propertiesin the categories Title and Subtitle.Axes~~~~The X-Axis and Y-Axis are shown by default in all VBX charts, except thePie Chart, Donut Chart, Funnel / Pyramid Chart, and any of theprogression components. The axis labels, tick marks, and gridlines areclosely linked and change with every change to the scaling parameters.The following sections outline the details for the axes formattingoptions.Axis Labels^^^^^^^^^^^The axis labels can be configured for the X-Axis as well as for theY-Axis and are either indicating a dimension member or the value for thedata series. You have the option to configure elements such as a Prefixor Suffix as well as the option to stagger the axis labels in order toimprove the readability.Ticks^^^^^Ticks are the lines placed along an axis to show either the differentvalues or to show the different dimension members. You can configure thedetails, such as the Tick Interval, Tick Placement, and Tick Position inthe category for each of the axis in the Additional Properties. Inaddition you have the option to enable major and minor ticks for thechart.Gridlines^^^^^^^^^In addition to the option to enable ticks for the axis, you can alsoenable gridlines for the X-Axis as well as the Y-Axis. You can configureelements, such as the gridline color, gridline style, and gridline widthfor each of the axis of the chart. Minor and major gridlines areavailable for the values axis, and major gridlines are available for thedimension axis.Tooltip~~~~~~~The tooltip appears when you will be hovering over a point in a dataseries. By default the tooltip shows the value of the point and the nameof the data series. At design time, the dashboard developer also has anoption to enable a crosshair option, which displays a line connectingthe points with their corresponding axis.Legend~~~~~~The legend will display the data series of the chart and display theassigned color and symbol of the data series. You also have the optionto hide / unhide a data series by clicking on the element in the legenditself.Plot Bands and Plot Lines~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The VBX charts provide the option to enable a plot line and plot bandfor both of the axis. A plot line or plot band provides you with theoption to highlight a specific area or to add a line for a specifiedthreshold value.Plot lines and plot bands provide the option to define the color, label,and the plot value/range. The lines and bands will always be in a 90degree angle to the axis it is defined for. When a plot band/line isused on the X- and Y-Axis at the same time, the plot band/line on theY-Axis will be shown in front, as seen in the example below (see Figure4.2)... figure:: _static/images/4.002.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.2: Plot bands andPlot lines in VBX ChartsPanning and Zooming~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Panning and Zooming area of the Additional Properties you havethe option to activate the zooming option for the X-Axis or Y-Axis. Youcan use the mouse pointer and drag out a rectangle in the chart itself,and the selected area will be used for zooming. Unlike pinch zooming,you can't pan the zoomed area, but has to zoom out on a new area. Ontouch devices, you can zoom by pinching in the chart area. On thesedevices, you may also move the zoomed area by panning with one fingeracross the chart.3D Charts~~~~~~~~~All the pie chart variants included in the VBX charts support a 3Doption. For all these charts, the following options are available:-  **Enabled**: This indicates whether the 3D option is enabled or not.   The possible values are true or false-  **Depth**: The total depth of the chart with a default value of 100.-  **Alpha & Beta**: The angles to rotate the view of the chart along   the X-axis and Y-axis respectively.Export ~~~~~~~All of the charts in the VBX suite do allow you to export the chart, asshown in Figure 4.3. The export feature supports the options to exportthe chart as a PDF, PNG, JPEG, or SVG vector file, or to print the chartdirectly. The dashboard designer has the option to enable or disable theexport and printing option as part of the Additional Properties of thechart in the category Export... figure:: _static/images/4.003.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.3: Export Modulein VBX ChartsExporting ChartsSince the export options uses server side scripting, an internetconnection is required to download the image or document.Chart Style Details~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As part of the Additional Properties each of the charts is offeringdetailed formatting options for elements such as the chart background,borders, plot areas, margin, padding, and so on. These details can befound in each of the different categories of the Additional Propertiesas well as in the category Appearance.Layout and Positioning^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^VBX Chart elements such as axis labels, data labels, legends, titles,and the export button can be positioned horizontally and vertically -relative to the top left corner - using the properties "Align" and"Vertical Align". The "Align" option can have the values left, right,and center. The Vertical Align property can have the values top, bottom,and middle.Plot Area, Margin, and Padding^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The plot area of the chart is the area within the axis, where the dataseries are plotted. In Figure 4.4 the plot area is shown as an orangebox. The margin options (Left Margin, Top Margin, etc) define the marginbetween the chart plot area and the chart borders. The padding options(Left Padding, Top Padding, etc) define the padding between the outerarea of the chart and all elements inside the chart area, such as datalabels and a legend... figure:: _static/images/4.004.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.4: Plot Area,Margin and Padding in VBX ChartsBorders^^^^^^^For chart elements, such as data labels, labels, and the legend it ispossible to define border details as part of the Additional Properties.The properties Border Width and Border Color can be used to define theborder details. In addition, the property Border Radius can be used toenable curved edges.Fonts^^^^^All layout elements of the chart that include text have a Style optionthat allows setting text related properties such as Font Color, FontStyle, Font Size, and Font Family. In addition there is an option todefine a global override option and to select a global font for allelements of the chart.Animation^^^^^^^^^The property Animation provides you the option to activate the chartanimation for situations where something has changed in the chart. Achange in the chart could be the change of a dimension, a drill down, ora scripted change of other chart properties. The default duration of theanimation is 500 ms.Conditional Formatting for Charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The charts as part of the Visual BI Extensions (VBX) allow you to definea set of conditional formatting rules, allowing you to highlightinformation displayed in the chart itself based on a variety ofconditions. You can define rules based on a comparison with a singlemeasure, with a measure calculation, or based on a target valuedefinition.The following charts support the Conditional Formatting capabilities:-  Pie Chart-  Pie Drilldown Chart-  Donut Chart-  Semicircle Donut Chart-  Funnel / Pyramid Chart-  Line Chart-  Column / Bar Chart-  Column / Bar Drilldown Chart-  Combination Chart-  Stacked Column Bar Chart-  Waterfall Chart-  Scatter Plot Chart-  Bubble Chart-  Fixed Column Chart   In the following sections we will outline the options to setup   Conditional Formatting for the charts and provides examples for all   three options to setup rules for this functionality.Conditional Formatting based on a Single Measures^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The first option for the Conditional Formatting is the ability to definerules based on a Single Measure. For our example we will assume that wehave a Data source which outlines measure Net Value along 12 months of ayear and we will use a Column / Bar Chart for our example (see Figure4.5). In addition our data source also contains the measure Cost andProfit... figure:: _static/images/4.005.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.5: Column / BarChartYou can follow the steps below to configure Conditional Formatting basedon a Single Measure:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows the measure Revenue along 12 months of the   dimension Calendar Month.3. Add a Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Column / Bar Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the   Additional Properties.7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the   sub category Conditional Formatting (see Figure 4.6)... figure:: _static/images/4.006.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.6: Category Data 8.

After you finished the details, please click on Save to add the rule    to the chart.In this scenario the selected dimension members will be highlighted withthe defined color.Configuring Identical Scaling~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As part of the Visual BI Extensions (VBX) for SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer, you can now configure several charts with anidentical scale. This option is not available for charts with more thanone Y-Axis or for charts without an axis, like the Pie chart. ForExample, if one chart displays sales values and a second chart displaysCost of Goods Sold, then by defining an identical Axis Group for theY-Axis in the Additional Properties, the dashboard designer canconfigure both of the charts with a common scale (see Figure 4.15).Following are the charts that support Identical Scaling:-  Column/Bar chart-  Combination chart-  Fixed Column chart-  Line chart-  Scatter Plot chart-  Stacked and Grouped Column chart-  Stacked Area chart-  Stacked Column/Bar chart-  Super Combination chartOnce, two or more charts are assigned to an identical scale, all thecharts assigned to this group will have the Y-Axis configured with acommon scale. If the first chart shows Sales values between $5 Millionand $10 Million and the second chart shows Cost values between $1Million and $6 Million, then both the charts will be normalized between$1 Million and $10 Million.To configure two or more charts with an identical scale, you can followthe steps listed below:1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer navigate to   the Additional Properties of the first chart.2. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Y-Axis.3. Navigate to the area Identical Scaling.4. Enter a new name for the property Identical Scaling Group Name and   click Add/Update.5. Now select the newly created group from the property Select Group   dropdown list.6. Select the second chart in your project.7. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Y-Axis for   the second chart.8. Navigate to the area Identical Scaling.9. Select the previously created group from the property Select Group   dropdown list (see Figure 4.15)... figure:: _static/images/4.015.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.15: IdenticalScalingBy assigning the identical group to both charts, you assigned bothcharts to an identical scaling and each time a change in scaling – forexample based on filter values – will automatically update both charts.Displaying Totals/Sub-totals~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Our charts also provide an option to display the Total and Sub-Totalvalues as a separate column or bar. This option can be enabled as partof the Additional Properties by navigating to the category Data and tothe sub category Data Series (see Figure 4.17). The sub-totals arecalculated as a summation of all data series for a particular dimensionmember. The totals and subtotals will be shown as a separate category onthe X-Axis or Y-Axis (as shown in Figure 4.16)... figure:: _static/images/4.016.JPG:align: centerFigure 4.16: Example fordisplaying Totals/Sub-totalsFigure 4.16 shows a Column Chart outlining the sales revenue for severalproducts and by activating the option Show Totals the chart would alsoinclude the Total Result values shown on the far right hand side foreach measure... figure:: _static/images/4.017.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.17: DisplayingTotals/Sub-totalsDisplaying Key & Text for Dimension Member~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All of the VBX charts are offering you the option to choose between theKey, Text, or Key and Text values of the dimension members for thedisplay in the charts. The option to configure the display of thedimension member is possible by navigating to the category Appearanceand to the sub category Chart and to the area General Settings (seeFigure 4.18). By default the charts will leverage the settings from theInitial View of the assigned data source, but you have the option tooverwrite the configuration on a per chart basis... figure:: _static/images/4.018.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.18: Displaying Key and TextHigh Chart Theming Support~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In addition to the standard style properties you will also find the areaChart Theme by navigating to the category Appearance and to the subcategory Chart of the Additional Properties (see Figure 4.19). Thedashboard designer can create a custom theme for the chart and in thatway quickly apply color settings and a defined look and feel to thecomplete chart.By clicking on the Custom Theme Editor, you will be guided to a separatewebsite (see Figure 4.20) and can configure the different elements ofthe chart and then export the necessary theme code... figure:: _static/images/4.019.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.19: High ChartTheming SupportYou can follow the steps below to apply a custom theme to your chart:1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira    Designer.2.  Add a VBX Chart – for example a Column / Bar chart – to your SAP    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.3.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.4.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart    and to the area Chart Theme (see Figure 4.19).5.  Click on the link Custom Theme Editor to open the Custom Theme    Editor (shown in Figure 4.20).6.  In the Custom Theme Editor select the type of chart from the    dropdown list in the top right corner.7.  Select a theme from the pre-configured list of themes or customize    the settings.8.  The Custom Theme Editor lists several properties where you can    modify the colors for elements such as chart background, Title,    legend, data series, data labels, and tooltips. Change the colors of    these properties as needed.9.  Once the changes are done, click Export.10. The custom code will be copied to the clipboard.11. Navigate back to your dashboard in SAP BusinessObjects Design    Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.12. Navigate to the Additional Properties.13. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart    and to the area Chart Theme.14. Now paste the custom theme code into the text area available in the    Custom Theme Code.15. Ensure the Enable Custom Theme option is activated... figure:: _static/images/4.020.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.20: Custom ThemeEditorAfter applying the Custom Theme Code and enabling the Custom Themesupport for the chart, the configured color settings should now beapplied to your chart.Support for Trendlines~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions for SAPBusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, most of the chartsalso are now able to support Trendlines as part of the visualization.Currently the supported Trendline types are: Linear, Exponential, andLoess. You can find the Trendline option as part of the AdditionalProperties for the chart by navigating to the category Data and to thesub category Trendline (see Figure 4.21)... figure:: _static/images/4.021.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.21: TrendlineAs shown in Figure 4.21, you can enable the support for the Trendlinesand you can choose for each individual measure which type of Trendlineyou would like to add to the chart. In the example above we added linearTrendlines for the measure Profit and Costs... figure:: _static/images/4.022.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.22: Column Chart with TrendlinesFigure 4.22 shows the resulting Column chart with both Trendlines addedto the visualization. In case you would like to add Trendlines only tosome of the measure but not to all measures, you can use the entry“None” from the dropdown box to not show a Trendline for some of themeasures.Trendlines are currently supported by the following chart types: Areachart, Bubble chart, Column / Bar chart, Line chart, Scatter Plot chart,Stacked Area chart, Stacked Column / Bar chart.Customizing Line Style and Marker Style~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions for SAPBusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, those charts thatoffer the display options of lines and markers – for example a Linechart – also provide the ability to customize those options. The optionsto customize the Line Style and Marker Style can be done by navigatingto the category Data and to the sub category Data Series and to the areaMarker in the Additional Properties of the chart (see Figure 4.23)... figure:: _static/images/4.023.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.23: Line and Marker OptionsFigure 4.23 shows the options to customize the Line Style and Markerstyle for a measure and you can try having more than one measure. Youhave the option to set a Line Style and customize the Marker Symbol,Marker Size, and Marker Color.Adding Error Bars~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions our charts alsoprovide the option to add Error Bars to the display of the chart. ErrorBars can be used to provide an additional visual representation of thevariability of the data and are normally used on graphs to indicate theerror range... figure:: _static/images/4.024.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.24: Error Bar OptionFigure 4.24 shows the detailed options for the Error Bar area bynavigating to the category Data and to the sub category Error Bar of theAdditional Properties.-  **Error Amount**: The Error Amount can be set to Fixed Value,   Percentage Value, Standard Deviation, or Custom. In case of the   option Custom you will then have the option to first choose the Data   Series and in addition you can then select measures from the data   source for the upper and lower limits of the error bars.-  **Error Amount Value**: In case of the Fixed Value or the Percentage   Value option, you can enter the corresponding value.-  **Stem Style**: You can leverage properties such as the Stem Width,   Stem Color, and Stem Style to configure the look and feel of the   Stem.-  **Whisker Style**: You can leverage properties such as the Whisker   Color, Whisker Length, and Whisker Width to configure the look and   feel of the Whisker.In case you choose the Custom option for the Error Amount you willreceive three additional configuration options:-  **Select Measure**: Here you can select a measure from the data   source and the Error Bar will be enabled for the selected measure.-  **Upper Limit**: Here you can select a measure from the underlying   data source as value for the upper limit of the Error Bar.-  **Lower Limit**: Here you can select a measure from the underlying   data source as value for the lower limit of the Error Bar... figure:: _static/images/4.025.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.25: Column Chart with Error BarsFigure 4.25 shows a Column chart with a simple Error Bar displayconfiguration.Editing Measure Labels~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions you can now changethe labels for the measures being used as part of the chart. By default,charts will use the label for the measure based on the meta-dataretrieved from the underlying source, but you can also customize thelabel as part of the Additional Properties (see Figure 4.26)... figure:: _static/images/4.026.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.26: Series Name ChangeNavigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series and tothe area Series Name Change. You can simply enter a new name for each ofthe available measures and the chart will then use the changed name aspart of the visualization.Configuring Drill Down for Charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As part of the VBX Charts you also receive a set of Drill Down charts,which are able to leverage multiple dimensions or a hierarchy from theassigned data source and provide your users with the ability to drilldown from an overview to a more detailed chart. In the followingsections we will outline the detailed options on how you can setup aDrill Down chart either based on multiple dimensions or based on ahierarchical data set. Drill Down charts either require multipledimensions as part of the data source or a dimension with an activatedhierarchy. In addition Drill Down Charts offer several advancedfeatures, which can be configured as part of the Additional Properties.You will have the option to either perform an actual Drill Down, meaningyou will navigate to a more detailed chart, or you can choose to expandthe chart inplace. For our first example on how you can configure aDrill Down Chart we will assume that our data source consists ofdimension Calendar Year and dimension Calendar Month as well as measuresRevenue and Cost.You can follow the steps below to setup your first Drill Down Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a Column / Bar Drilldown chart to your SAP BusinessObjects Design   Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.3. Add a data source to your project. For our example we assume the data   source has dimension Calendar Year and Calendar Month, as well as   measures Revenue and Cost.4. Assign the data source to the chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View   **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Drill Down (see   Figure 4.27)... figure:: _static/images/4.027.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.27: Category Data 8. In the sub category Drill Down you have several options to configure   the Drill Down behavior. You can find the details in Table 4.5:+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+| Option                            | Description                       |+===================================+===================================+| Show all Measures                 | You can use this property to      ||                                   | enable / disable the showing of   ||                                   | all measures in a Drilldown.

For our example we will activate the following options:    -  Show Parent Nodes on Drilldown    -  Show all Measures    -  Activate Hierarchical Labeling10. For all other options we will use the default values, which means    that you will be able to use a drill down with a double-click and    the inplace Expand / Collapse option with a single-click.11. Now use the menu Application **•** Execute Locally to see the chart    and use the Drilldown.12. Your initial view of the chart should look similar to Figure 4.28... figure:: _static/images/4.028.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.28: Drilldown Chart13. Now use a double-click on any of the columns in the chart (see    Figure 4.29)... figure:: _static/images/4.029.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.29: Drilldown Chart14. You can now see the next dimension based on the Drilldown and    because we activated the option to see all measures, we can see    measure Revenue and measure Cost. In addition we can see the parent    node shown on the left hand side, in our example the node for the    year 2014.15. Click on the Back button in the top right corner to go back to the    initial view.16. Now use a single click on the measure for the year 2014 (see Figure    4.30)... figure:: _static/images/4.030.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.30: Drilldown Chart17. In this example we expanded the data to the next level. In our    example we expanded the year 2014 to show the 12 members of    dimension Calendar Month. In addition we can now see the    hierarchical labeling showing the year and month labels in separate    rows and we can also notice that the entry for the year 2015 is    still visible because we used the inplace expand instead of the    drilldown.18. Close the browser and navigate back to SAP BusinessObjects Design    Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.In the first example we used the Drill Down chart with a set ofdimensions. In our next example we will use the Drill Down chart with ahierarchy from the assigned data source.You can follow the steps below to setup your first Drill Down Chart witha hierarchy:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a Column / Bar Drilldown chart to your SAP BusinessObjects Design   Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.3. Add a data source to your project. For our example we assume the data   source has dimension Product with an activated hierarchy, as well as   measures Revenue and Cost along that hierarchy.4. Assign the data source to the chart. You will notice that the chart   does not display the hierarchical information, because we first need   to activate the hierarchical drill down.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View   **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Drill Down8. In the area Hierarchy Drilldown, activate the option Enable Hierarchy   Drill Down.9. You will notice that the chart now shows the hierarchy from the   underlying data source (see Figure 4.31)... figure:: _static/images/4.031.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.31: Hierarchical Drill Down Chart10. You have the same options for the configuration (see Table 4.5) as    well as navigation when you execute the application.11. For the configuration in regards to the Drill Down we will use the    default values, which means that you will be able to use a drill    down with a double-click and the inplace Expand / Collapse option    with the single-click.12. Now use the menu Application **•** Execute Locally to see the chart    and use the Drilldown.13. Your initial view of the chart should look similar to Figure 4.31    and you should be able to use a Drill Down as well as an inplace    Expand / Collapse navigation.In just a few steps we were able to use the Drill Down functionality ofthe chart and use a set of dimensions and a hierarchy to visualize ourdata.Events~~~~~~In addition to the Additional Properties, the charts are also offeringthe ability to add scripting code to specific events. The VBX chartssupport the following events:-  On Plot Background Click-  After Chart Load-  On Zoom-  On SelectIn addition, those charts that do support plot bands - such as the Trend& Comparison charts - also support the following events in addition tothe events listed above:-  On X-axis Plot Band Mouse Over-  On Y-axis Plot Band Mouse Over.Lasso and Reverse Lasso Selection~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Lasso and Reverse Lasso selection allows you to either use a lassoselection and select those elements in the chart that are included inthe selected area or to use a reverse lasso selection, which will selectall elements of the chart that are outside of the selected area. In thefollowing steps we will outline how you can leverage the Lasso andReverse Lasso selection with the Visual BI Extension charts.Lasso Selection^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^As part of the standard menu of the Visual BI Extension Charts you havethe option to select the Lasso option (see Figure 4.32). The Lassooption will select those elements in the chart that are inside theselected area. For our example, we will use a Column Chart with twomeasures – Forecast Amount and Sales Amount – and several dimensionmembers... figure:: _static/images/4.032.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.32: Lasso – ChartMenu1. After you have activated the Lasso option from the chart menu, you   can then select the elements in the chart (see Figure 4.33)– in our   example the measures for dimension member Round Rugs and Curtains... figure:: _static/images/4.033.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.33: Item Selectionin chart2. After you selected the items, the selected items will follow the   color assignment for the selected items (see Figure 4.34) and the   selected members can also be retrieved using the scripting functions   for the chart... figure:: _static/images/4.034.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.34: Lasso Reverse Lasso Selection^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^As part of the standard menu of the Visual BI Extension Charts you havethe option to select the Reverse Lasso option (see Figure 4.35). TheReverse Lasso option will select those elements in the chart that areoutside the selected area. For our example, we will use a Column Chartwith two measures – Forecast Amount and Sales Amount – and severaldimension members... figure:: _static/images/4.035.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.35: Reverse Lasso– Chart Menu1. After you have activated the Reverse Lasso option from the chart   menu, you can then select the elements in the chart (see Figure 4.36)   – in our example the measures for dimension member Round Rugs and   Curtains... figure:: _static/images/4.036.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.36: Item Selectionin chart2. After you have selected the items, the items outside the selected   area will follow the color assignment for the unselected items (see   Figure 4.37) and the unselected members can also be retrieved using   the scripting functions for the chart... figure:: _static/images/4.037.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.37: Reverse Lasso In the last section we have outlined the steps on you can leverage theLasso and Reverse Lasso selection with the Visual BI Extension charts.In the next section, we will outline on the steps on you can enable /disable a Loading message for the Visual BI Extension chart.Ability to have a loading and hiding message via scripting~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Show Loading^^^^^^^^^^^^As part of the chart functionality you have the option to enable /disable a Loading message for situations, for example, where the chartis loading a larger dataset. You can use scripting functions to triggerthe showing and hiding of the loading message.You can follow the steps below for an example:1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira    Designer.2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume    that our data source shows two measures - Forecast Amount and Sales    Amount – and one dimension Product.3.  Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4.  Make sure the Name of your Column Bar Chart in the Standard    Properties is shown as CHART1.5.  Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart.6.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart.7.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the    Additional Properties.8.

Add the following scripting:CHART1.DSXShowLoading();11. Click OK to close the script editor.12. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.13. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.14. You will be able to view the loading message for the chart (see    Figure 4.38)... figure:: _static/images/4.038.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.38: Loading MessageHide Loading^^^^^^^^^^^^In the previous steps we enabled the loading message and in the nextsteps we will incorporate the hiding of the message.You can follow the steps below for an example:1. Use the project we created in the previous steps with the loading   message being shown when the chart is being loaded.2. We will now add a button to the dashboard that will allow you to hide   the loading message.3. Ensure you have the previous project open in SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.4. Add a Button from the Basic Components to the canvas.5. Ensure that the Button is being placed outside of the chart area, so   that the button will not overlap with the loading message for the   chart.6. Navigate to the Standard Properties of the Button.7. In case the Standard Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Properties to activate the display of the Standard   Properties.8. Open the script editor for the onClick.9. Add the following scripting:CHART2.DSXHideLoading();10. Click OK to close the script editor.11. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.12. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.You will be able to view the chart and initially the loading messagewill be shown and you have the option to click on the button to hide theloading message (see Figure 4.39)... figure:: _static/images/4.039.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.39: Hiding MessageMaster / Detail option for the charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~With the new Master Detail functionality for the Visual BI ExtensionCharts you now have the option to enable a miniature display of thecomplete chart and data for navigation purposes (see Figure 4.40)... figure:: _static/images/4.040.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.40: Master DetailsChart Figure 4.40 shows an example of a Column Chart with the Master Detailfunctionality enabled and you are now able to select a range of thecomplete chart in the Master Details display, which then will focus thechart on the selected area. This functionality is implemented for thefollowing charts:-  Area-  Bullet-  Column Bar-  Dual Axes-  Fixed Column-  Group Stacked Column Bar-  Line-  Multiple Axes-  Stacked Area-  Stacked Column BarThe following steps show a simple example on how you can use the MasterDetail functionality:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows two measures - Forecast Amount and Sales Amount   – and one dimension Product.3. Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart from the Standard   Properties (see Figure 4.41)... figure:: _static/images/4.041.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.41: Assign DataSource5.

Based on the above configuration you will be able to view the Area    Chart with the appearance of the Series Labels for the measures    Order Quantity and Order Amount inside the chart area (see Figure    4.85)... figure:: _static/images/sl2.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.85: Area Chartwith Series LabelsSeries Labels are currently supported by the following chart types: Areachart, Line chart, Stacked Area chartand Stream Graph.Pattern as Series Options in Charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Additional Properties of the Charts in the category Data and thesub category Data Series, you can configure the pattern for the Seriesin the area Series Options and visualize the chart based on the appliedpattern (see Figure 4.86)... figure:: _static/images/seriespattern1.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.86: Pattern asSeries OptionFor our example, based on the above configuration as shown in Figure4.86 you will be able to view the Area Chart with Pattern applied asSeries Option for the Series Name Order Cost (see Figure 4.87)... figure:: _static/images/seriespattern2.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.87: Area Chartwith Pattern as Series OptionPattern as Series options are currently supported by the following charttypes: Area chart, Column / Bar chart, Combination chart, Donut Chart,Dual Axis chart, Fixed Column Bar chart, Funnel chart, Multi Axes chart,Pie chart, Semicircle Donut chart, Stacked Area chart, Stacked Column /Bar chart, Stacked and Grouped Column chart and Super Combination chart.Ranking in Data Series ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Additional Properties of the Charts in the category Data and thesub category Data Series, you can define a custom ranking based on theavailable measures in the area Ranking and visualize the chart based onthe applied Ranking to the particular Measure (see Figure 4.88)... figure:: _static/images/seriesranking1.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.88: Ranking For our example, based on the above configuration as shown in Figure4.88 you will be able to view the Line Chart for the Ranking MeasureOrder Cost with Rank top 3 so that the Line chart is visualized for thetop 3 Order Cost values (see Figure 4.89)... figure:: _static/images/seriesranking2.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.89: Line Chartwith Ranking for top 3 valuesDimension for Ranking in Data SeriesThe Dimensions to be assigned for the Ranking in Data Series will notsupport more than two dimensions.Conditional Formatting in Charts using Groups~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Starting with release 2.3 of the Visual BI Extensions for SAPBusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, most of the chartsalso are now able to support Conditional Formatting using LogicalOperators OR and AND. You can find this option as part of the AdditionalProperties for the chart by navigating to the category Data and to thesub category Conditional Formatting.For illustration part, you can follow the steps to configure a new GanttResource Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer project (see section 7.2.6).Now follow the below steps to configure the Conditional Formatting forthe Gantt Resource Chart using Logical Operators OR and AND.1. After completing the configuration part, navigate to the category   Appearance and to the sub category Chart in the additional properties   of the Gantt Chart and set the property Select Chart Type to the   option Gantt (see Figure 4.90)... figure:: _static/images/OR1.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.90: CategoryAppearance2. Now navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Conditional   Formatting (see Figure 4.91).3. Click Create Group... figure:: _static/images/OR2.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.91: Create Group4. Enter the Group Name as Group 1.5. For our example, set the property Logical Condition to the value OR.6. Set the property Highlighted Measure to the option Progress.7. Set the property Color to the color Red.8. Click Save and the Group 1 will be created. By default, the Rule 1   will be created for the Group 1 where it can be edited based on your   choice (see Figure 4.92). We can also create as many Rules for the   created Group... figure:: _static/images/OR3.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.92: Created Groupand Rule9. For our example, click Edit for Rule 1 (see Figure 4.93)... figure:: _static/images/OR4.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.93: Edit Rule 110. Set the property Rule Type to the option Single Measure.11. Set the property Comparison Measure to the option Progress.12. Set the property Operator to the option Greater than.13. Set the property Comparison Value Type to the option Static.14. Set the property Comparison Value to the value 50.15. Now Click Add New Rule to add another Rule (see Figure 4.94).16. Enter the Rule Name as Rule 2... figure:: _static/images/OR5.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.94: Rule 217. Set the property Rule Type to the option Single Measure.18. Set the property Comparison Measure to the option Progress.19. Set the property Operator to the option Between.20. Set the property Comparison Value Type to the option Static.21. Set the property Start Value Type to the value 50.22. Set the property End Value Type to the value 60.23. Click Save and Rule 2 will be created (see Figure 4.95)... figure:: _static/images/OR6.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.95: Rule 1 andRule 224. Based on the above set of configurations, you will be able to    visualize the Gantt Chart using the logical OR operator for both the    Rule 1 and Rule 2 (see Figure 4.96)... figure:: _static/images/OR7.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.96: Gantt Chartusing Logical OR operator25. Here you can observe that the Progress values for both the Rule 1    and Rule 2 will be displayed in the Gantt Chart (represented by red    color) based on the conditions “greater than 50” and values “between    50 and 60”.26. Based on the above set of configurations, when logical operator AND    is applied for the Rule 1 and Rule 2, then you can observe that the    Progress values in the Gantt Chart (represented by red color in    Figure 4.97) will be visualized satisfying both Rules which denotes    that it considers all the values above 50 (Rule1) and within the    range from 50 to 60 (Rule 2)... figure:: _static/images/OR8.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.97: Gantt Chartusing Logical AND operator  Rule Type SelectionAfter creating a Group, if you set the property Rule Type to the optionas “Target Value” for Rule 1, then additional Rules cannot be createdfurther for that Group. If the property Rule Type for Rule 1 is set toother options namely Single Measure, Measure Calculation and Dimension,then additional Rules can be created for that Group.Working with Data-----------------In the following sections we will outline a set of steps in SAPBusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer which will help you toget a better understanding on how the VBX charts are able to leveragethe data as part of your next project in SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer.Assigning a Data Source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Each of the VBX charts will require a connection to a data source aspart of the SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designerproject. To add a data source to your SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer project you can use a right click on the DataSource folder in the Outline of your project and select the menu AddData Source (see Figure 4.98)... figure:: _static/images/4.076.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.98: Adding a Data SourceIn the pop up window as shown in Figure 4.99 you can first select aConnection and after doing so you can browse for a Data Source. Afteryou selected the Data Source you can specify an Alias for the datasource, which will be used as reference to the data source throughoutyour application. You can confirm the dialog using the OK button... figure:: _static/images/4.077.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.99: Specify Data Connection and Data SourceTo edit the default view of the data source, right click on the newlyadded data source in the Outline of your SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer application and select the meu option EditInitial View… as shown in Figure 4.100... figure:: _static/images/4.078.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.100: Edit Initial ViewThe Initial View Editor (see Figure 4.101) allows to select rows,columns, and filters for the view of your data source as well asconfiguring properties such as a scaling factor for a measure. Bydefault, all the dimensions and measures added to the Rows, Columns, andBackground Filter will be used when the data source is being assigned toa component... figure:: _static/images/4.079.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.101: Edit Initial ViewAfter the data source has been added to the SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer project, it can be assigned to the chartsfrom the VBX suite. You can assign the data source to a component usingthe property Data Source (see Figure 4.102) or using a simple drag anddrop navigation, dragging the data source from the Outline to thecomponent in your project... figure:: _static/images/4.080.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.102: Data Source SelectionData Utility Feature in VBX Charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Each of the charts in the VBX suite also comes with the option to enablethe Data Utility tool (see Figure 4.103). The Data Utility functionalityprovides you with the ability to select a subset of dimensions andmeasures from the assigned data source for the chart. For example, yourdata source could contain the dimensions Product Category and Region,and the measures Sales Amount and Profit Amount, but your chart issupposed to only display the Sales Amount by Region. In this situationthe Data Utility allows you to re-use this data source and select thedimensions and measure that should be used, instead of using thecomplete data set. As the Data Utility tool allows you to specify thedimensions and measures per chart, it helps you to reduce the overallnumber of data source and in that way helps you to improve the overallperformance of your application... figure:: _static/images/4.081.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.103: Data Tab – VBX Charts Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility inthe Additional Properties of the VBX Charts (see Figure 4.103). Afteryou enabled the Data Utility tool by activating the option Enable DataUtility Tool, you can set the Data Source Definition type and selectboth the measures and dimensions (see Figure 4.104). All Dimensions thatare available in the Rows and Columns of the initial view are shown aspart of the Rows, Columns, and Measures area of the Data Utility tool... figure:: _static/images/4.082.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.104: Data Utility boxData Source Definition^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^As part of the Data Utility tool, you have the option to configure theproperty “Data Source Definition” to be based on the Technical ID or tobe based on the Index.-  The option Technical ID allows you to specify the dimensions and   measures based on their technical names.-  The option Index Based allows you to specify an index value (zero   based index), and the index will specify the position of the   dimension or measure in the assigned data source. For example a index   of 2 for the measure will then use the third measure (0, 1, 2) of the   assigned data source. By using the option Index based, you can keep   the dimension and measure assignment dynamic, as the Data Utility   will then always leverage the dimensions and measures based on the   assigned index, even when there are changes in the underlying   structure of the data source.For our example we will select the option “Technical ID” as shown inFigure 4.105. The dimension Region is selected, along with the measuresProfit and Net Value... figure:: _static/images/4.083.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.105: Data UtilityYou also have the option to set the following properties for the DataUtility (see Figure 4.105).-  Include Result from Data Source: This property allows you to include   Totals and Subtotals from the Initial View of the Data source.-  Include Result: When this property is activated, you have the option   to include totals / subtotals for the selected dimension / measures   and choose the aggregation function in the next property.-  Measure Aggregation: Using this property, you can configure the   aggregation function for the totals / subtotals. The available   options are: Min, Max, Average, Count, Distinct Count, Sum,   Percentage Share, and Running Total.-  Suppression Type – This property allows you to configure a Zero and   Null suppression for the Rows and Columns. The Zero / Null   Suppression will be performed on the configured element of the Data   Utility Tool.Common Properties of VBX Charts-------------------------------The following sections outlines the common properties of the VBX Chartsthat are available in the Additional Properties. Properties that arespecific to a particular chart component are discussed separately.General~~~~~~~The General category lists the component name and type which are notcustomizable. The property Visible controls the visibility of thecomponent dynamically.Data Binding~~~~~~~~~~~~The dashboard designer can use the Data Source property in the StandardProperties of the chart to assign a data source to the chart. Inaddition you can leverage the previously mentioned Data Utility tool.Display~~~~~~~The CSS Class property in the Standard Properties allows you to specifythe CSS class name that is added to the component at runtime. This classcan be referenced using the custom CSS file from the applicationproperties.Layout~~~~~~Properties related to the component margins and size are available underthe Layout category in the Standard Properties. For any component, amaximum of two properties between margins and size can be set to autofor the component to adjust the size and position dynamically.Additional Properties Sheet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Additional Properties sheet consists of options and attributes tocontrol the look and feel of the VBX charts. This sheet also enablesusers to modify properties related to advanced interactivities such asdrilldown, panning and zooming, etc. Figure 4.106 highlights theavailable tabs of an Additional Property sheet for a line chart... figure:: _static/images/4.084.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.106: AdditionalProperties - TabsExcept for a few unique properties for specific charts (like gauges andcounters), all VBX charts share a common set of properties grouped underthe categories discussed below. Exceptions from these categories includevalue axis for Gauges, 3D options for Pie charts, and text styles forCounters.Category General^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The following section outlines the

Suite consists of a group of chart components that highlighttrends over time or are used to compare elements among each other.Trend and Comparison Charts Overview~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As part of the list of charts in the VBX suite, you also receive a setof Trend and Comparison Charts. This group includes the followingcharts: Line Chart, Column / Bar Chart, Combination Chart, and AreaChart. In the following sections we will outline the details for each ofthese chart types.Line Chart ~~~~~~~~~~~The Line Chart is represented by a series of values connected with astraight line. Line Charts are most often used to visualize data thatchanges over time to indicate a potential trend. The Line Chart in theVBX suite also has an option to indicate the trend as a spline (smoothedline) instead of a standard straight line. A sample line chart is shownin Figure 4.107... figure:: _static/images/4.085.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.107: Line ChartData Source Requirements for a Line Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Line Chart are at least onedimension and one measure. In case the data source does containadditional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the DataUtility tool to specify which information is to be used by the LineChart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart.How to use the Line Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new LineChart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designerproject.You can follow the steps below to configure the Line Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows the measures Revenue and Cost along 12 months   of the dimension Calendar Month.3. Add a Line Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Line Chart.5. The Line Chart will plot the information from the assigned data   source (see Figure 4.108)... figure:: _static/images/4.086.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.108: Line ChartFigure 4.108 shows the basic Line Chart for two measures. You can usenow the Additional Properties to customize the layout and look and feel.Column / Bar Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Column / Bar Chart component is similar to a Line Chart, except thatthe information is visualized either as columns or as bars. Figure 4.109shows a sample column chart... figure:: _static/images/4.087.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.109: Column / Bar ChartOption for Runtime Deviation Bar in Column Bar Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart in the categoryAppearance and the sub category Chart, you have the option to activatethe property Enable Deviation Bar to display the Deviation Value betweenone Column Bar and the other Column Bar. The deviation will berepresented through a thin line bar showing the positive deviation ingreen color and the negative deviation in red color.For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure theDeviation Bar in the Column Bar Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows the measure Order Quantity along the dimension   Item Category.3. Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects/SAP Lumira Designer.4. Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the   Additional Properties.7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and   to the sub category Chart (see Figure 4.110).8. Activate the option Enable Deviation Bar (see Figure 4.110)... figure:: _static/images/run1.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.110: EnableDeviation Bar9. Based on the above configured settings, you will be able to visualize   the Column Bar Chart enabled with Deviation Bar (see Figure 4.111).   In our example, you can observe that a positive Deviation Order   Quantity value of 93104 occurs for the dimension Movies in comparison   with the dimension Books. The deviation will be calculated as Mouse   Hover Column Bar Value Minus (-) Selected Column Bar Value. In our   example, the Mouse Hover Column Bar takes the Dimension “Movies” and   the Selected Column Bar takes the Dimension “Books”... figure:: _static/images/run2.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.111: Column BarChart with Runtime Deviation Bar10. Now navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category    Chart (see Figure 4.112).11. Activate the option Deviation as % (see Figure 4.112)... figure:: _static/images/run3.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.112: EnableDeviation as %12. Based on the above configured settings, you will be able to    visualize the Column Bar Chart enabled with the option Deviation as    % (see Figure 4.113). In our example, you can observe that a    positive Deviation Order Quantity value of 48.74% occurs for the    dimension Movies in comparison with the dimension Books. The    deviation will be calculated as Mouse Hover Column Bar Value Minus    (-) Selected Column Bar Value Divide (/) by Selected Column Bar    Value x 100. In our example, the Mouse Hover Column Bar takes the    Dimension “Movies” and the Selected Column Bar takes the Dimension    “Books”... figure:: _static/images/run4.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.113: Column BarChart with Runtime Deviation Bar in %Deviation as %The option Deviation as % will be only functional when the option EnableDeviation Bar is enabled in the Additional Properties of the Column BarChart.Option to enable Pareto Series in Column Bar Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart in the categoryAppearance and the sub category Chart, you have the option to activatethe property Enable Pareto Series to display both Column bars and a Linewhere individual values are represented in descending order by columnbars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line.The Column Bar Chart with Pareto Series is useful for figuring out themost significant factors in your data and how they contribute to theentire set. Also, you can discover the areas for improvement from thePareto Series. For our example, you can follow the steps below toconfigure the Pareto Series in the Column Bar Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows the measure Number of Mobile Phone Returns   along the dimension Return Reasons.3. Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the   Additional Properties.7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and   to the sub category Chart (see Figure 4.114).8. Activate the option Enable Pareto Series (see Figure 4.114)... figure:: _static/images/4.088.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.114: Enable ParetoSeriesBased on the above configured settings, you will be able to visualizethe Column Bar Chart enabled with Pareto Series (see Figure 4.115). Inour example, you can observe the following:-  The Pareto line starts at the center of the Defect category and   intersects the right vertical axis at 40 percent, meaning Defects   account for 40 percent of all Mobile Phone returns.-  Moving along the Pareto line, the next stop is the center of   Incorrect Pricing. The Pareto line at Incorrect Pricing intersects   the contributing percentage axis at 70 percent, which means that the   combination of Defects and Incorrect Pricing account for 70 percent   of all Mobile Phone returns.-  One more category over, Wrong Product intersects the Pareto axis a   little bit above 80 percent, which means 80 percent of all Mobile   Phone returns are a result of Defects, Incorrect Pricing and Wrong   Product... figure:: _static/images/4.089.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.115: Column BarChart with Pareto SeriesNow you can discover the areas for improvement where the Mobile PhoneStore should allocate its efforts. Targeting improvements to Defects andIncorrect Pricing are more worthwhile than adjusting the prices(Expensive) or Quality of Mobile Phones (Poor Quality).Data Source Requirements for a Column / Bar Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Column / Bar Chart are atleast one dimension and one measure. In case the data source doescontain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leveragethe Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by theColumn / Bar Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set ontothe chart.How to use the Column / Bar Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Bar Chartas part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP LumiraDesigner project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Column / Bar Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows the measures Revenue and Cost along a set of   members of dimension Product.3. Add a Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Column / Bar Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the   Additional Properties.7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and   to the sub category Chart (see Figure 4.116)... figure:: _static/images/4.090.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.116: AdditionalProperties8. In the area General Settings set the property Select Chart Type to   the option Bar.9. The Column / Bar Chart will plot the information from the assigned   data source (see Figure 4.117)... figure:: _static/images/4.091.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.117: Sample BarChartYou can now customize the display of the chart using the availablesettings in the Additional Properties.Combination Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The combination chart allows you to combine a line chart and a columnchart into a single chart with a single axis. A sample combination chartis shown in Figure 4.118... figure:: _static/images/4.092.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.118: CombinationChartOrder of Displaying Different Chart Types~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Additional Properties of the Combination Chart in the categoryData and the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the“Series Order” for displaying the different chart types. By changing theSeries Order of the measure items, the respective legend for the measureitems will be changed based on the changed Series Order.For our example, in the additional properties of the Combination Chartthe default Series Order for the measure items is shown in Figure 4.119... figure:: _static/images/4.093.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.119: Default SeriesOrderBased on the above configuration, the Combination Chart will bedisplayed with the default order of legend items (see Figure 4.120)... figure:: _static/images/4.094.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.120: Default SeriesOrderFor our example, in the additional properties of the Combination Chartchange the Series Order for the measure items (see Figure 4.121)... figure:: _static/images/4.095.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.121: Changed SeriesOrderBased on the above configuration, the Combination Chart will bedisplayed with the changed order of legend items (see Figure 4.122)... figure:: _static/images/4.096.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.122: Changed SeriesOrderData Source Requirements for a Combination Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Combination Chart are at leastone dimension and two measures. In case the data source does containadditional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the DataUtility tool to specify which information is to be used by theCombination Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set ontothe chart.How to use the Combination Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a newCombination Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Combination Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows three measures: Revenue, Cost, and Profit along   a set of members of dimension Product.3. Add a Combination Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Combination Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the   Additional Properties.7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the   sub category Data Series (see Figure 4.123)... figure:: _static/images/4.097.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.123: Category Data 8. In the area Series Type you are presented with the option to choose   the Series Type for each of the data series from the assigned data   source. You can choose between the following options:   -  Column   -  Column Stacked   -  Line   -  Spline   -  Area   -  Area Stacked   -  Area Spline   -  Area Spline Stacked9. For our example we will configure measure Revenue as Column, measure   Cost as Column, and measure Profit as a Line (see Figure 4.124)... figure:: _static/images/4.098.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.124: CombinationChartNumber of AxisPlease note, that the Combination Chart is using a single Axis to plotthe different data series values. In case you prefer to use two or moreAxis we recommend to use the Dual Axis or the Multiple Axis chart.Area Chart~~~~~~~~~~An Area Chart is a line chart that displays quantitative data and wherethe area below the line is being filled with one color (see Figure4.125). Area charts depict a time-series relationship, but unlike LineCharts, Area Charts can also visually represent volume... figure:: _static/images/4.099.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.125: Area ChartFigure 4.125 shows a sample Area Chart with measure Sales along the 12months of dimension Calendar Month.Data Source Requirements for an Area Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for an Area Chart are at least onedimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain moreinformation, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify whichinformation is to be used by the Area chart or you can decide to plotthe complete data set onto the chart. In case the data source containsmore than a single measure, the order of the measures in the initialview of the data source then decides the order of plotting the measureonto the chart.How to use the Area Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new AreaChart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designerproject.You can follow the steps below to configure the Area Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows the measures Revenue and Cost along 12 months   of dimension Calendar Month.3. Add an Area Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the chart.5. After the data source has been assigned, the chart plots the members   of the dimension for the X-Axis and the measure values are plotted as   area (see Figure 4.126)... figure:: _static/images/4.100.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.126: Sample AreaChart6. The area between the axis and the line is filled with the selected   color based on the configuration in the category Data for each of the   Data Series.7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in   the Additional Properties of the chart.8. Using the property Select Chart Type you can choose between:   -  Area: This is a classic vertical Area chart with the value axis      (Y-Axis) being on the vertical axis.   -  Area Horizontal: This is a horizontal Area chart with the value      axis (X-Axis) being on the horizontal axis.   -  Area Spline: The Area Spline chart uses a smoothed line (spline)      with the values axis (Y-Axis) on the vertical axis.   -  Area Spline Horizontal: The Area Spline Horizontal chart uses a      smoothed line (spline) with the values axis (X-Axis) on the      horizontal axis.9. You can enable Markers and customize the display of the Markers in   the area Marker of the category Data. You can customize the Marker   Symbol, Size, and Color.Order of DisplayIn case you are planning to visualize multiple measures in an AreaChart, please note that the first measure in the data source will be themeasure being displayed first and any additional measure will bedisplayed in front of the first measure. The display order of themeasures is (assuming measures are organized in columns) from left toright.Column / Bar Drill Down Chart ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Column / Bar Drilldown Chart is an enhanced version of the Column /Bar Chart. The additional feature is the ability to drill down from theinitial view into a more detailed chart. The drill down can be based ona set of dimensions or it can be based on an available hierarchyprovided by the data source... figure:: _static/images/4.101.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.127: ColumnDrilldown ChartFigure 4.127 shows the initial view of a Column Drilldown chart with themeasures Revenue and Cost for the years 2014 and 2015. You can now use adouble-click on the elements of the chart and drill down to the nextlevel, which would show the 12 months for the selected measure (seeFigure 4.128).1.. figure:: _static/images/4.028.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.28: Drilldown ChartYou always have the option to use the Back navigation in the top rightcorner to navigate back to the initial view.Data Source Requirements for an Column / Bar Drilldown Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Column / Bar Drilldown Chartare at least two dimensions and one measure or an active hierarchy andone measure. In case the data source does contain more information, youcan leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to beused by the Column / Bar Drilldown chart or you can decide to plot thecomplete data set onto the chart.How to use the Column / Bar Drilldown Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Column /Bar Drilldown Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAPLumira Designer project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Area Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source has a dimension Year and a dimension Month as well as   a set of measures.3. Add a Column / Bar Drilldown Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the chart.5. After the data source has been assigned, the chart will use the first   dimension for the initial view and second dimension for the first   drill down... figure:: _static/images/4.103.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.129: Sample DrillDown Chart 6.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.7.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •    Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional    Properties.8.  Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Drill Down.9.  In the area General Settings and in the area Hierarchy Drill Down    you have several options to configure the Drill Down behavior. You    can find the details in Table 4.5.10. For our example we will activate the following options    -  Show Parent Nodes on Drill Down    -  Show all Measures    -  Activate Hierarchical Labeling11. For all other options we will use the default values, which means    that you will be able to use a drill down with a double-click and    the inplace Expand / Collapse option with a single-click.12. Now use the menu Application • Execute Locally to see the chart and    use the Drilldown.13. Your initial view of the chart should look similar to Figure 4.129    and you should be able to use a double-click for a Drilldown and a    single click for an inplace Expand / Collapse.Hierarchical Drill DownPlease note, that there is no need to expand the hierarchy in theinitial view of the data source and that there is no limit in number oflevels that can be used as part of a hierarchical drill down.Radar Chart~~~~~~~~~~~A Radar chart allows you visualize the values of one or more measuresalong several members of a dimension and instead of arranging thosevalue as columns or bars, those values are arranged radially around apoint. For example, Radar Charts can be effectively used in comparisonbetween two or more products over a range of characteristics todetermine its features... figure:: _static/images/4.104.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.130: Sample Radar ChartFigure 4.130 shows a sample Radar Chart outlining the measure valueslong 12 months and comparing multiple regions.The Radar Chart provides four different versions of the Radar Chart:-  Radar Chart-  Radar Filled Chart-  Radar Column Chart-  Radar Column Stacked Chart.. figure:: _static/images/4.105.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.131: Radar Filled ChartFigure 4.131 shows a Radar Filled Chart, where instead of justvisualizing the measure values in form of lines, the values are beingvisualized in form of overlapping areas... figure:: _static/images/4.106.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.132: Radar Column ChartFigure 4.132 showing a Radar Column Chart, comparing the values of eachdata series in form of a column against each other... figure:: _static/images/4.107.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.133: Radar Column Stacked ChartFigure 4.133 showing a Radar Column Stacked Chart comparing the valuesin form of a stacked column along the axis.Data Source Requirements for a Radar Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Radar Chart are at least onedimension and one measure. In case the data source does containadditional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the DataUtility tool to specify which information is to be used by the RadarChart.You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for aRadar Chart:-  Each Dimension or Measure placed into the Rows of the Initial View of   the Data Source will be used for the outer Axis of the Radar chart.-  Each Dimension or Measure placed into the Columns of the Initial View   of the Data source will be used as a data series represented in form   of a line in the Radar Chart.How to use the Radar Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new RadarChart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP LumiraDesigner project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Radar Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows the measures Net Value, Cost, and Profit in the   Rows of the Initial View and dimension Product in the Columns of the   Initial View.3. Add a Radar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Radar Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Radar Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the   Additional Properties.7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and   to the sub category Chart (see Figure 4.134)... figure:: _static/images/4.108.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.134: Category Appearance8. In the area General Settings set the property Select Chart Type to   the value Radar... figure:: _static/images/4.109.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.135: Radar Chart9. Your Radar Chart should now look similar to Figure 4.135.Polar Chart~~~~~~~~~~~Polar Charts are very similar to the previously mentioned Radar Chart,with the difference being that the data is shown in a circular shapeinstead of a typical radar style shape (see Figure 4.136)... figure:: _static/images/4.110.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.136: Polar ChartData Source Requirements for a Polar Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Polar Chart are at least onedimension and one measure. In case the data source does containadditional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the DataUtility tool to specify which information is to be used by the RadarChart.You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for aPolar Chart:-  Each Dimension or Measure placed into the Rows of the Initial View of   the Data Source will be used for the outer Axis of the Polar chart.-  Each Dimension or Measure placed into the Columns of the Initial View   of the Data source will be used as a data series represented in form   of a line in the Polar Chart.How to use the Polar Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new PolarChart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP LumiraDesigner project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Radar Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows the measures Net Value, Cost, and Profit in the   Rows of the Initial View and dimension Product in the Columns of the   Initial View.3.

In the area General Settings set the property Select Chart Type to   the value Polar and you can visualize the Polar Chart in circular   shape instead of a typical radar style shape (see Figure 4.136).Slope Chart~~~~~~~~~~~Slope Charts are perfect for highlighting the story of how just onecategory decreased when other categories increased, or to show that onecategory increased at a rate much faster than the other categories.Slope Chart looks similar to Line Chart, but with certain visualchanges, as slope chart serves the different purpose... figure:: _static/images/slp1.jpg:align: centerFigure4.137: Sample Slope ChartData Source Requirements for a Slope Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The mandatory data source requirement for a Slope Chart are twodimensions and one measure. In case the data source does containadditional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the DataUtility tool to specify which information is to be used by the SlopeChart.How to use the Slope Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new SlopeChart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designerproject.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows one measure – Order Quantity and two Dimensions   – Calendar Year and Item Category.3. Add a Slope Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio /SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Slope Chart.5. The Slope Chart will plot the information from the assigned data   source (see Figure 4.138)... figure:: _static/images/slp2.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.138: Slope ChartFigure 4.138 shows the basic Slope Chart for one measure and twodimensions. Here you can observe that the measure Order Quantity for thedimension members Electronics, Music and Movies gets decreased from thecalendar year 2007 to 2009 and at the same time, the measure OrderQuantity for the dimension member Books gets increased from the calendaryear 2007 to 2009.Advanced Column Bar Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Advanced Column Bar Chart offers an intuitive way to compare any twomeasures. In addition to comparing two measures, it also adds aspotlight to the variance between these measures in terms of absoluteand percentage values. Negative or Positive variance is automaticallycategorized as two series. This removes the need to add conditionalformatting to highlight the quality of variance... figure:: _static/images/acb1.jpg:align: centerFigure4.139: Sample Advanced Column Bar ChartData Source Requirements for a Advanced Column / Bar Chart ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Advanced Column / Bar Chartare at least one dimension and two measures to form a minimum of twoData Series where the Chart can be configured only for two series. Incase the data source does contain additional dimension or additionalmeasures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify whichinformation is to be used by the Advanced Column / Bar Chart.How to use the Advanced Column / Bar Chart? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new AdvancedColumn Bar Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Advanced Column / BarChart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows the measures Order Cost, Order Amount and Order   Quantity along a set of members of dimension Item Category.3. Add a Advanced Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Advanced Column / Bar Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Advanced Column / Bar   Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the   Additional Properties.7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the   sub category Data Series (see Figure 4.140)... figure:: _static/images/acb2.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.140: Category Data– Series Options8.  In the area Series Options, you can change the color for the series.    For our example, set the Series Order Cost to the color Orange.9.  Set the Series Order Amount to the color Blue.10. Since the Chart considers only the first two data series in the    Columns of the Initial View you will be able to set the colors for    the first two data series Order Cost and Order Amount.11. By default, the Series Positive and Negative will have Green and Red    colors. You can also change their colors based on your choice.12. Now navigate to the area Series Name Change (see Figure 4.141).. figure:: _static/images/acb3.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.141: Category Data– Series Name Change13. Set the Series Order Cost to the name Order Cost.14. Set the Series Order Amount to the name Order Amount.15. Set the property ∆PY to the name Var (restricted to 5 characters).16. Set the property ∆PY% to the name Var% (restricted to 5 characters).17. Now navigate to the area Shape Options (see Figure 4.142)... figure:: _static/images/acb4.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.142: Category Data– Shape Options18. Set the property Deviation Shape to the option Square. The other    options are Diamond and Circle.19. Set the property Deviation Shape Color to the color Black.20. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the subcategory Chart    (see Figure 4.143)... figure:: _static/images/acb5.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.143: CategoryAppearance 21. Set the property Set the Chart Type to the option Column.22. Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the    Advanced Column Bar Chart (see Figure 4.144). Here you can observe    that there are three layers where the bottom layer 1 represents the    Column Bar Chart for the first two data series Order Cost and Order    Amount against the dimension Item Category. In this case, you can    observe that the column bar chart gets displayed based on the    comparison of the two data series taken as measures. Also, the data    label gets displayed for the data series having higher value. The    middle layer 2 shows the vertical column bars representing the    Variance value for the first two data series Order Cost and Order    Amount calculated as Series 2 value (Order Amount) – Series 1 value    (Order Cost). The positive variance value will be denoted in green    color vertical bars and the negative variance value will be denoted    in red color vertical bars (see Figure 4.144). The top layer 3 shows    the thin vertical column bars with deviation shapes at its top. Here    the Variance % value for the first two data series Order Cost and    Order Amount is calculated as Series 2 value (Order Amount) – Series    1 value (Order Cost) /Series 1 value (Order Cost) X 100. The    positive variance percentage value will be denoted in green color    vertical bars and the negative variance percentage value will be    denoted in red color vertical bars (see Figure 4.144)... figure:: _static/images/acb6.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.144: AdvancedColumn Bar ChartChart Type Selections for Advanced Column Bar Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the additional properties of the Advanced Column Bar Chart in thecategory Appearance and the subcategory Chart, you have different ChartType options that can be configured for the Advanced Column Bar Chart.The options are Column, Column-Pin, Column-Stacked, Column-Deviation,Bar, Bar-Pin, Bar-Stacked, Bar-Deviation and Line.For our first example, set the property Set the Chart Type to the optionColumn-Pin (see Figure 4.145)... figure:: _static/images/acb7.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.145: CategoryAppearanceBased on the above configuration, you will be able to view the AdvancedColumn Bar Chart configured as Column-Pin chart type (see Figure 4.146).You can observe that bottom layer is configured with Column-Pin charttype having the Primary Measure as Order Cost and Secondary Measure asOrder Amount... figure:: _static/images/acb8.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.146: Column-PinChart TypeHere you can also change the Primary and Secondary Measure shapes forthe Column Pin chart type by navigating to the category Data and to thesubcategory Data Series (see Figure 4.147)... figure:: _static/images/acb9.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.147: Category Data– Shape OptionsFor our second example, navigate to the category Appearance and to thesubcategory Chart and set the property Set the Chart Type to the optionColumn-Deviation (see Figure 4.148)... figure:: _static/images/acb10.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.148: CategoryAppearanceBased on the above configuration, you will be able to view the AdvancedColumn Bar Chart configured as Column-Deviation chart type (see Figure4.149). You can observe that bottom layer is configured withColumn-Deviation chart type. Here the secondary measure Order Amount isviewed as Column Bar Charts and the primary measure Order Cost will berepresented as the positive deviation bar in green color that occursinside the Column Bar Chart and the negative deviation bar in red colorthat occurs on the top of the Column Bar Chart. You can also configurewith different chart types to view the Advanced Column Bar Chart... figure:: _static/images/acb11.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.149: Column-DeviationChart TypeAdditional Properties of the Trend Charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Propertiesfor all charts.

the charts in the overall VBX suite, you also receive severalvariants of a pie chart. Pie charts are best used when making apart-to-whole comparison with a limited set of members. As part of thisgroup of Pie Charts you can use the following charts (see Figure 4.150):-  Pie Chart-  Donut Chart-  Semicircle Donut Chart-  Pie Drilldown Chart.. figure:: _static/images/4.111.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.150: Pie ChartVariantsIn the following sections we will outline the basic functionality andthe steps to create each of the variants of the Pie Chart.Pie Chart~~~~~~~~~Pie Charts are used to compare a part to the total for the selectedmeasure... figure:: _static/images/4.112.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.151: Pie ChartFigure 4.151 shows a classic Pie Chart, outlining the measure valuealong five members of a dimension.Data Source Requirements for a Pie Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Pie Chart are at least onedimension and one measure. In case the data source does containadditional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the DataUtility tool to specify which information is to be used by the PieChart.How to use the Pie Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Pie Chartas part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP LumiraDesigner project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Pie Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows measure Revenue along a set of members of   dimension Product.3. Add a Pie Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Pie Chart... figure:: _static/images/4.113.jpg:align: centerFigure4.152:Pie Chart with Data Labels5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.6.

The chartrequires at least two dimensions as part of the assigned data source anddisplays the first dimension as the initial display and the second (ormore) dimension(s) will be used for the drilldown.Data Source Requirements for a Pie Drilldown Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Pie Drilldown Chart are atleast two dimensions and one measure. In case the data source doescontain additional dimensions or additional measures, you can leveragethe Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used orleverage the complete data set. The Pie Drilldown Chart can onlyvisualize a single measure at a time.How to use the Pie Drilldown Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new PieDrilldown Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer project. We will assume that our data setconsists of dimension Product Category, dimension Product, and measureRevenue.You can follow the steps below to configure the Semicircle Donut Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project.3. Add a Semicircle Donut Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Semicircle Donut Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data   Label.8. Activate the option Enable Data Labels.9. In the sub category Data Label set the property Display Format to the   option Percentage and you will be able to visualize the Pie Drilldown   Chart (see Figure 4.157)... figure:: _static/images/4.118.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.157: Pie Drilldown Chart10. Now use a double-click on any of the slides, and the Pie Chart will    get updated with the next level (see Figure 4.158)... figure:: _static/images/4.119.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.158: Pie Drilldown ChartFigure 4.158 shows the Pie Chart with the next level Drill Down afteryou have clicked on a slice in the initial view. In regards to thenumber of Drill Down levels, there is no actual limit on the number ofdrill downs.Spie Chart~~~~~~~~~~A Spie Chart is an overloaded version of a Pie chart, where you can varythe height of each segmentalong with its width. Unlike Pie, Spie will take two measures, where onemeasure represents the slice’svolume and other represents the slice’s radius... figure:: _static/images/spieintro.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.159: Spie ChartData Source Requirements for a Spie Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Spie Chart is at least onedimension and one measure. In case the data source does containadditional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the DataUtility tool to specify which information is to be used by the SpieChart.How to use the Spie Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new SpieChart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP LumiraDesigner project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Spie Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows two measures - Order Quantity and Order Cost   and two dimensions - Item Category and Item Subcategory.3. Add a Spie Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Spie Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series   (see Figure 4.160)... figure:: _static/images/spienew1.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.160: Category Data8.  In the area Chart Settings, set the property Select Measure for    Volume to the option Order Quantity.9.  Set the property Select Measure for Radius to the option Order Cost.10. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart    (see Figure 4.161)... figure:: _static/images/spienew2.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.161:  Category Appearance11. In the area General Settings, select Chart Type to the option Pie.    The other option is Donut.12. Based on the above configuration you will be able to view the Spie    Chart with the Measure Order Quantity representing the volume of the    slice and the Measure Order Cost representing the radius of the    slice (see Figure 4.162). You can use now the Additional Properties    of the Spie Chart to customize the layout and look and feel... figure:: _static/images/spienew3.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.162: Spie Chartwith two dimensions and two measuresAdditional Properties of Pie Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In addition to the common properties of the charts, which are outlinedin section 4.5, the pie

The following stacked charts areincluded in the VBX suite:-  Stacked Area Chart-  Stacked Column Chart-  Stacked Bar Chart-  Stacked Percentage Column Chart-  Stacked Percentage Bar Chart-  Stacked and Grouped Column Chart.. figure:: _static/images/4.120.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.163: Stacked ChartsIn the next sections we will provide details for a subset of allavailable stacked charts to outline the steps to use these chart types.We will outline the Stacked Column, Stacked Percentage Column, and theStacked and Grouped Column Chart in more details. The Stacked Area andStacked Bar charts are very similar to the Stacked Column chart type andyou should be able to follow the steps even when using the Stacked Areaor Stacked Bar chart type.Stacked Column Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Stacked Column Chart provides you with the option to visualize ameasure along two dimensions, with one dimension being displayed on theX-Axis and the other dimension being used to stack the values (seeFigure 4.164)... figure:: _static/images/4.121.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.164: Stacked ColumnChartFigure 4.164 shows a Stacked Column Chart displaying the measure valuealong a dimension for the Calendar Month as well as using dimensionRegion to stack the values for each column.Data Source Requirements for a Stacked Column Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Stacked Column Chart are atleast one dimensions and one measure. In case the data source doescontain additional dimensions or additional measures, you can leveragethe Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by thechart or use the complete data set as part of the visualization. AStacked Column Chart can stack either the values by a dimension or stackmeasure values, which depends on the data source assigned to the chart... figure:: _static/images/4.122.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.165: Simple StackedChartFigure 4.165 shows a Stacked Column Chart with one dimension and twomeasures. In this scenario the dimension is being used for the X-Axis ofthe chart and the two measures are being stacked... figure:: _static/images/4.123.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.166: Stacked ChartFigure 4.166 shows another Stacked Column Chart, in this example we haveone dimension Month in the Rows, one Dimension Product in the Columns,and a measure Costs in the Columns.You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for aStacked Column Chart:-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data   Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.-  Each Dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the   Data source will be used for the stacking of the chart.How to use the Stacked Column Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new StackedColumn Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAPLumira Designer project. For our example we will assume that we have adata source with two dimensions – dimension Month and dimension Product– as well as one measures – Revenue. In the initial View of the datasource we placed the dimension Month into the Rows, dimension Product isplaced into the columns, and measure Revenue is placed into the Columns.You can follow the steps below to configure the Stacked Column Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows measures Revenue and along dimension Month and   Product.3. Add a Stacked Column Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.8. In the area General Settings set the Select Chart Type to the value   Stacked Column (see Figure 4.167)... figure:: _static/images/4.124.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.167: Category Appearance9.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data    Label.10. Activate the option Enable Data Labels.11. In the sub category Data Label activate the property Data Labels in    Percent and you will be able to visualize the Stacked Column Chart    (see Figure 4.168)... figure:: _static/images/4.125.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.168: Stacked ColumnChartFigure 4.168 shows the result of our example with the values ofdimension Month showing on the X-Axis and the members of dimensionProduct are used to stack up the values of the measure.Stacked Percentage Column Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Stacked Percentage Column Chart is very similar to the previouslyoutlined Stacked Column Chart, with the difference being that the valuesare shown on a percentage scale (see Figure 4.169)... figure:: _static/images/4.126.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.169: StackedPercentage Column ChartFigure 4.169 shows a Stacked Percentage Column Chart displaying themeasure value along a dimension for the Calendar Month on the X-Axis anddimension Product as the dimension to stack the measure value.Data Source Requirements for a Stacked Percentage Column Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Stacked Percentage ColumnChart are at least one dimension and one measure. In case the datasource does contain additional dimensions or additional measures, youcan leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to beused by the chart or use the complete data set as part of thevisualization. A Stacked Percentage Column Chart can stack either thevalues by a dimension or stack measure values, which depends on the datasource assigned to the chart.You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for aStacked Percentage Column Chart:-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data   Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.-  Each Dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the   Data source will be used for the stacking of the chart.How to use the Stacked Percentage Column Chart? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new StackedColumn Percentage Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer project. For our example we will assume thatwe have a data source with two dimensions – dimension Month anddimension Product – as well as one measure – Revenue. In the initialView of the data source we placed the dimension Month into the Rows,dimension Product is placed into the columns, and measure Revenue isplaced into the Columns.You can follow the steps below to configure the Stacked PercentageColumn Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows measures Revenue along dimension Month and   Product.3. Add a Stacked Column Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.8. In the area General Settings set the Select Chart Type to the value   Stacked Percentage Column and you will be able to visualize the   Stacked Percentage Column Chart (see Figure 4.169).Stacked and Grouped Column Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Stacked and Grouped Column Chart allows you to not only stack valuesfor a specific dimension but to also group values along a seconddimension, so in total the chart allows you to visualize the informationof three dimensions... figure:: _static/images/4.127.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.170: Stacked andGrouped Column ChartFigure 4.170 shows a Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart visualizingdimension Region on the X-Axis and stacking up the values for thedifferent products – Food, Home Appliances, and Electronics – for twogroups.Data Source Requirements for a Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Stacked and Grouped ColumChart are at least one dimension in the Rows, one dimension in theColumns, and one measure in the initial view of the data source. In casethe data source does contain additional dimensions or additionalmeasures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify whichinformation is to be used by the chart or use the complete data set aspart of the visualization.You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for aStacked and Grouped Column Chart:-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data   Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.-  Each dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the   Data Source will be used to stack items inside each group.-  Measures will be used to group items together.How to use the Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Stackedand Grouped Colum Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects DesignStudio/SAP Lumira Designer project. For our example we will assume thatwe have a data source with dimension Month in the Rows, dimensionProduct Category in the Columns, and dimension Product Group as seconddimension in the Columns as well as measure Net Value in the Columns.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project.3. Add a Stacked and Grouped Column Chart from the VBX Charts to your   SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.8. In the area General Settings set the Select Chart Type to the value   Stacked Grouped Column and you will be able to visualize the Stacked   and Grouped Column Chart (see Figure 4.171)... figure:: _static/images/changedstacked.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.171: Stacked andGrouped Column ChartFigure 4.171 shows dimension Month along the X-Axis, dimensions ItemCategory and Item Sub category are being used to stack items inside eachgroup and measure Order Cost is being used to group items together.Stream Graph~~~~~~~~~~~~Stream Graph is a variation of a Stacked Area Chart, but instead ofplotting values against a fixed, straight axis, a Stream Graph hasvalues displaced around a varying central baseline. Stream Graphdisplays the changes in data over time of different categories with thehelp of flowing, organic shapes that somewhat resemble a river-likestream... figure:: _static/images/stream1.jpg:align: centerFigure4.172: SampleStream GraphData Source Requirements for a Stream Graph^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Stream Graph is one dimensionand one measure. In case the data source does contain additionaldimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility toolto specify which information is to be used by the Stream Graph.How to use the Stream Graph?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new StreamGraph in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designerproject.You can follow the steps below to configure the Stream Graph:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows four measures – Order Cost, Discount Amount,   Order Quantity and Order Amount and two Dimensions – Item Category   and Item Subcategory.3. Add a Stream Graph from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio /SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Stream Graph.5. The Stream Graph will plot the information from the assigned data   source (see Figure 4.173)... figure:: _static/images/stream2.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.173: Stream GraphFigure 4.173 shows the basic Stream Graph for four measures and twodimensions. Here you can observe that the Measure Order Cost for theDimension Item Subcategory Computers is 1,585,319 where the value isshown through the central baseline instead of plotting values againstthe axes. You can use now the Additional Properties to customize thelayout and look and feel.Additional Properties of Stacked Charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Propertiesoutlined in section 4.5, the stacked charts also provide the AdditionalProperties for the X-Axis and Y-Axis outlined in section 4.5.5.1.Scripting in Stacked Charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All supported scripting functions for the Stacked Charts are listed aspart of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section 4.6.Gauges------As part of the VBX Suite of charts, you also have the option to leveragethe gauges as part of your next dashboarding project using SAPBusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.Gauges Overview~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A Gauge is a simple visualization used to display a single or twomeasure values (see Figure 4.174).

Scripting FunctionsFunnel Charts-------------Funnel charts are used to visualize the progressive reduction of data asit passes from one phase to another, for example the data of a salesprocess with data starting with the sales leads on the top and goingdown to the qualified leads and finally to the closed deals.Funnel Charts Overview~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As part of the VBX suite there are two different funnel charts availableto you:-  Funnel / Pyramid Chart-  Funnel / Pyramid Drilldown ChartWhile the Funnel / Pyramid chart is the basic chart to representprogressive stages of data, the Funnel / Pyramid Drilldown chart offersan extension of the basic functionality by adding the Drill Downfunctionality to the chart. Figure 4.204 shows a Funnel and Pyramidchart example... figure:: _static/images/4.159.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.204: Funnel /Pyramid ChartData Source Requirements for a Funnel / Pyramid Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Funnel / Pyramid Chart is adata source with a minimum of one dimension and one measure. In case ofthe Funnel / Pyramid Drilldown Chart the minimum requirements are tohave at least two dimensions and one measure.How to use the Funnel / Pyramid Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new FunnelChart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP LumiraDesigner project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Solid Gauge:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows a measure Revenue along dimension Sales Stage.3. Add a Funnel Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Funnel Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Funnel Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and   to the sub category Chart.8. In the area General Settings ensure that the property Select Chart   Type is set to the value Funnel... figure:: _static/images/4.160.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.205: Funnel Chart9. Your Funnel Chart should look similar to Figure 4.205 now.Additional Properties of Funnel Components~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Additional Properties of the Funnel charts are shown as part of thecommon set of Additional Properties in section 4.5.Scripting Functions for Funnel Charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All supported scripting functions for the Funnel Charts are listed aspart of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section 4.6.Progression Components----------------------Part of the VBX Chart are also a set of components that can be used toshow the progress of a single value against a given target values.Progression Components Overview~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The following is a list of progression components that are included aspart of the VBX suite (see Figure 4.206):-  Progress bar-  Number counter-  Circular counter.. figure:: _static/images/4.161.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.206: ProgressionComponentsData Source Requirements for a Progress Component^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for any of the Progress Componentsis a data source with a minimum of one data cell. The progresscomponents will visualize the value of a single cell and therefore youwill have to configure a Data Selection in addition to assigning thedata source to the component.How to use the Progress Bar?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new ProgressBar, which is one of the Progress Components. The Number Counter andCircular Counter are working very similar and you should be able tofollow the steps below with those components as well.1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira    Designer.2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume    that our data source shows measure Revenue along dimension Product.3.  Add a Progress Bar from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects    Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4.  Assign the data source to the Progress Bar.5.  Navigate to the Standard Properties of the Progress Bar.6.  In case the Standard Properties are not shown, use the menu View •    Standard Properties to activate the display of the Standard    Properties (see Figure 4.176).7.  Select the property Data Selection.8.  Use the button on the right hand side to open the Data Selection    dialog.9.  In the next dialog you have the option to select a single cell from    the overall data set.10. Select a single cell.11. Click OK to close the dialog.12. Your Progress Bar should look similar to Figure 4.207... figure:: _static/images/4.162.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.207: Progress BarAdditional Properties of Progress Components~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Propertiesoutlined in section 4.5, the Progress Components support the followingAdditional Properties in the following categories... _category-general-2:Category General^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+|

The VBX Waterfall chart has the ability to add anintermediate result, which can show the balance at a defined data point... figure:: _static/images/4.163.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.208: WaterfallChartData Source Requirements for a Waterfall Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Waterfall Chart are a datasource with at least one dimension and one measure. The data sourceshould indicate the positive and negative values. In case the datasource does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you canleverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to beused by the Line Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data setonto the chart.How to use the Waterfall Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new WaterfallChart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a datasource with a dimension showing the value type and a measure with theactual value.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows a single measure along a dimension Value Type.3. Add a Waterfall Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Waterfall Chart.5. Your initial chart should look similar to Figure 4.209... figure:: _static/images/4.164.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.209: WaterfallChart6. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Waterfall Chart.7. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.8. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series   (see Figure 4.210)... figure:: _static/images/4.165.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.210: AdditionalProperties9.  In the area Chart Settings you can activate the option of an    Intermediate Summary and you can choose after which value the    Intermediate Summary will be placed using the property Place    Intermediate Sum After.10. You also have the ability to enable a custom sort option and you can    configure elements from the assigned data source as an Interim or    Final Balance.11. For our example we place an Intermediate Summary after the value for    the Service Revenue.12. Our Waterfall Chart looks now like shown in Figure 4.211... figure:: _static/images/4.166.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.211: WaterfallChartSorting Options for Waterfall Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^By navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series,you can activate the properties Sort By and Enable Custom Sort to enablethe sorting options for the Waterfall chart.**Sort By**: Using this property in the area Chart Settings, you cansort the dimension members on the X-Axis based on a set of options. Theoptions are Initial View, Dimension Text in Ascending order, DimensionText in Descending order, Dimension Key in Ascending order, andDimension Key in Descending order. For our example, we have selected theoption Dimension Text in Descending order (see Figure 4.212)... figure:: _static/images/4.167.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.212:Sort By option**Enable Custom Sort**: Using this property in the area Chart Settings,you can sort the dimension members on the X-Axis by defining a customsort order. For our example, we created a custom sort order by swappingthe dimension member Audio Equipment in the place of Cameras (see Figure4.213)... figure:: _static/images/4.168.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.213:Custom SortBased on the Custom Sort configuration, the Waterfall Chart will beshown as in Figure 4.214... figure:: _static/images/4.169.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.214:Custom SortEnable Interim / Final Balance from Data Source^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^If you wish to have an existing entry from the data source as anIntermediate Balance/Final Balance, then you can enable the propertyEnable Interim/Final Balance from the Data Source in the area ChartSettings. For our example, we have selected the existing entry asdimension member “Audio Equipment” and assigned the option asIntermediate Balance for that dimension member (see Figure 4.215)... figure:: _static/images/4.170.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.215:Intermediate Balance SelectionBased on the above configuration, you will be able to visualize theWaterfall Chart as shown in (see Figure 4.216)... figure:: _static/images/4.171.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.216:Intermediate Balance on Dimension MemberSorting and Hierarchy Drill Down optionsThe Custom Sorting and Interim/Final Balance options will not functionwhen the Drill Down options for the Waterfall Chart is enabled.Hierarchy Drill Down options for Waterfall Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Starting with the release 2.0 of the Visual BI Extensions, you areprovided with the following Hierarchy Drill Down options. You canconfigure the details by navigating to the category Data and to the subcategory Drill Down (see Figure 4.217)... figure:: _static/images/4.172.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.217:Hierarchy Drill Down**Enable Hierarchy Drill Down**: Using this property, you can enable theHierarchy Drill Down for the Waterfall chart based on the activeHierarchy based on the Initial View of the data source.**Include Root Level Nodes**: Using this property you can include orexclude the Root Level Nodes of the active hierarchy.**Max no. of Hierarchy Levels**: Using this property, you can specifythe maximum number of levels from the hierarchy, which will be availablefor the Drill Down navigation. By specifying the maximum number ofhierarchy levels you can limit the data volume, which you will be ableto retrieve using the drilldown option.**Activate Hierarchical Labeling**: Using this property you can activatea specific labeling which will visualize the hierarchical nature of thedata and keep the labels on the X-Axis grouped together based on thehierarchical structure. For our example the labels of the both Categoryand Sub category items appear on the X-Axis (see Figure 4.218).. figure:: _static/images/4.173.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.218:Hierarchical Labeling**Enable Drill Down**: Using the property Enable Drill Down, you will beable to enable the Drill Down option for the Waterfall Chart. For ourexample, we have assigned the data set having the dimensions ItemCategory and Item Subcategory and measure Order Cost. Based on thisconfiguration you will be able to visualize the Waterfall Chart withdimension Item Category with its dimension members for the measure OrderCost (see Figure 4.219). When you double click on any one of thedimension member of the dimension Item Category - for our example“Books” - it gets drilled down to the next level showing the WaterfallChart with dimension members for the dimension Item Subcategory (seeFigure 4.220)... figure:: _static/images/4.174.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.219:Waterfall Chart with Dimension Item Category.. figure:: _static/images/4.175.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.220:Waterfall Chart – Drilled Down to Dimension Item Subcategory**Enable Hierarchy Drill Down**: When the property Hierarchical DrillDown is enabled, then you need to assign a data source having Hierarchydata set and visualize the Waterfall Chart based on the Hierarchy DrillDown configuration. In this scenario you will be able to visualize theWaterfall Chart representing the parent nodes and when you double clickon any one element of the parent node, it gets drilled down to the nextlevel showing the Waterfall Chart with the elements of the child node.Hierarchy Drill Down optionThe Hierarchy Drill Down option will only function when the Drill Downoption for the Waterfall Chart is enabled.Additional Properties of the Waterfall chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Propertiesoutlined in section 4.5 and the Additional Properties for the X-Axis andY-Axis outlined in section 4.5.5.1, the Waterfall supports the followingAdditional Properties... _category-data-4:Category Data ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+| Sub category    | Area            | Property        | Description     |+=================+=================+=================+=================+| Data Series     | Chart Settings  | Enable Final    | This property   ||                 |                 | Balance         | enables the     ||                 |                 |                 | option to show  ||                 |                 |                 | a final balance ||                 |                 |                 | as part of the  ||                 |                 |                 | chart.          |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+|                 |                 | Place           | This property   ||                 |                 | Intermediate    | allows you to   ||                 |                 | Sum After       | place an        ||                 |                 |                 | intermediate    ||                 |                 |                 | summary after a ||                 |                 |                 | selected value  ||                 |                 |                 | of the data     ||                 |                 |                 | series.         |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+|                 |                 | Sort By         | This property   ||                 |                 |                 | allows you to   ||                 |                 |                 | set the sorting ||                 |                 |                 | options.

The twodimensions are being used to set the X-Axis as well as the Y-Axis, andthe measure is being used to indicate – in form of a colored matrix –the value for the combination of these two dimensions... figure:: _static/images/4.176.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.221: Heat Map ChartData Source Requirements for a Heat Map Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Heat Map Chart are a datasource with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one dimension in theColumns of the Initial View of the data source. In addition the datasource should contain at least one measure. In case the data source doescontain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leveragethe Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by theHeat Map Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto thechart.You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a HeatMap Chart:-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data   Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.-  Each Dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the   Data source will be used for the Y-Axis of the chart.How to use the Heat Map Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Heat MapChart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a datasource with a dimension Month in the Rows, a dimension Product in theColumns, and a measure Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of thedata source.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined   previously.3.

In case the data source does contain additional dimension oradditional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specifywhich information is to be used by the Bubble Chart or you can decide toplot the complete data set onto the chart.You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for aBubble Chart:-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data   Source will be used as a Data Series element and you can assign the   different colors in the Additional Properties.-  The first measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the   Data Source will be used for the X-Axis.-  The second measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the   Data Source will be used for the Y-Axis.-  The third measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the   Data Source will be used for the Bubble size.How to use the Bubble Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new BubbleChart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a datasource with a dimension Product in the Rows and measures Revenue, Cost,and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined   previously.3. Add a Bubble Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Bubble Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Bubble Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series   (see Figure 4.227)... figure:: _static/images/4.182.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.227: Bubble Chart8. In the area Series Color you can define the color for each data   series of the chart.Additional Properties of the Bubble Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Propertiesoutlined in section 4.5 and the Additional Properties for the X-Axis andY-Axis outlined in section 4.5.5.1, the Bubble Chart supports thefollowing Additional Properties... _category-general-4:Category General^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+| Sub category    | Area            | Property        | Description     |+=================+=================+=================+=================+| X-Axis          | General         | Cross Value     | Here you can    ||                 | Settings        |                 | specify at      ||                 |                 |                 | which value the ||                 |                 |                 | X-Axis will     ||                 |                 |                 | cross the       ||                 |                 |                 | X-Axis.         |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+| Y-Axis          | General         | Cross Value     | Here you can    ||                 | Settings        |                 | specify at      ||                 |                 |                 | which value the ||                 |                 |                 | Y-Axis will     ||                 |                 |                 | cross the       ||                 |                 |                 | Y-Axis.         |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+Table 4.29: General.. _data-2:Data ^^^^^+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+| Sub category    | Area            | Property        | Description     |+=================+=================+=================+=================+| Data Series     | Chart Settings  | Swap Axes       | Using this      ||                 |                 |                 | property you    ||                 |                 |                 | can swap the    ||                 |                 |                 | X-Axis and      ||                 |                 |                 | Y-Axis from the ||                 |                 |                 | chart.          |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+|                 | Series Color    | Series Color    | In the Series   ||                 |                 |                 | color area you  ||                 |                 |                 | can define the  ||                 |                 |                 | color as well   ||                 |                 |                 | as the symbol   ||                 |                 |                 | for each data   ||                 |                 |                 | series element. |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+Table 4.30: DataScripting Functions for the Bubble Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All supported scripting functions for the Bubble Chart are listed insection 4.6.Marimekko Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A Marimekko chart is essentially a stacked column chart with a variablecolumn width. In addition to the varying segment heights of a regularstacked column chart, a Marimekko chart is indicating an additionaldimension using varying column widths. The variable column width on theX-Axis is based on the share of each member in relation to the total... figure:: _static/images/4.183.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.228: MarimekkoChartFigure 4.228 shows a Marimekko Chart with the Product Group on theX-Axis showing the percentage values in relation to the total value andthe individual Product is plotted in form of a stacked column chart foreach individual Product Group.Data Source Requirements for a Marimekko Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Marimekko Chart are a datasource with at least two dimensions in the Rows, and one measure in theColumns. In case the data source does contain additional dimension oradditional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specifywhich information is to be used by the Marimekko Chart or you can decideto plot the complete data set onto the chart.You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for aMarimekko Chart:-  The first Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the   Data Source will be used as Dimension for the X-Axis.-  The second Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the   Data Source will be used as Dimension for the stacking of the values.How to use the Marimekko Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new MarimekkoChart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a datasource with a dimension Month and a dimension Product in the Rows andmeasures Revenue in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined   previously.3. Add a Marimekko Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Marimekko Chart... figure:: _static/images/4.184.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.229: MarimekkoChart5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Marimekko Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the Additional Properties.7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart   (see Figure 4.230)... figure:: _static/images/4.185.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.230: Additional Properties8.  In the area General Settings you can use the Select Chart Type    property to setup a Marimekko Standard Chart or a Marimekko    Percentage Chart.9.  Now navigate to the category General and to the sub category X-Axis.10. Scroll down to the area Axis Label (see Figure 4.231)... figure:: _static/images/4.186.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.231: Category General-  X-Axis11. The property Enable Total Display allows you to display the Total    for each data series on the X-Axis as numerical value.12. The property Display Total in Percentage allows you to display the    Total for each data series on the X-Axis as percentage value share    of the total value.13. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.14. Scroll down to the area General Settings (see Figure 4.232)... figure:: _static/images/4.187.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.232: CategoryAppearance15. The property Visualize Total allows you to activate an extra area    next to the Marimekko Chart, which visualizes the Total values for    each of the stacked dimension members (see Figure 4.233)... figure:: _static/images/4.188.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.233: MarimekkoChart with Total Values16. The property Visualize Total in Percent allows you to show the    Totals in percentage values based on share.17. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility    (see Figure 4.234)... figure:: _static/images/4.189.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.234: Data Utility18. In the sub category Data Utility you can choose which dimension will    be used for the Width on the X-Axis and which dimension will be used    for stacking up the values. In addition you can choose the measure    from the underlying data source.Additional Properties of the Marimekko Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In addition to supporting the

You can follow the steps below to configure the TreeMap Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows two measures - Sales Amount and Forecast Amount   - and one dimension Product.3. Add a Tree Map Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Tree Map Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Tree Map Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the   Additional Properties.7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in   the Additional Properties of the Tree Map Chart. In the area General   Settings you can configure the type of Tree Map Chart using the   property Select Chart Type. There are five different types and each   type represents a different option to position and size the data:-  Slice and Dice-  Stripes-  Squarified-  Strip-  Horizontal stripes8. For our example, you can set the property Select Chart Type to the   option Slice and Dice (see Figure 4.236).. figure:: _static/images/4.191.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.236: Tree Map Chart– Category Appearance 9.  Ensure that the property Enable Redraw is activated, so that the    chart will be redrawn when the browser window is being resized at    run time.10. Set the property Dimension Value Display to the option Text Only.    This property allows you to choose if the dimension should be    displayed with the Key, Text, or both values.11. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of    the Additional Properties for the Tree Map Chart. In the area Chart    Settings you can assign the measures from your data source to the    Size and Color options for the chart. (see Figure 4.237)... figure:: _static/images/4.192.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.237: Tree Map Chart– Category Data 12. Set the property Select Measure for Size to the measure Forecast    Amount.13. Set the property Minimum Value Color to light blue.14. Set the property Select Measure for Color to the measure Sales    Amount.15. Set the property Minimum Value Color to dark blue.16. Set the property Select Type of Color Scheme to the option Min-Max    Color which configures the type of color scheme that will be used.    The options for the color schemes are listed below-  Min-Max Color-  Series Color-  Custom Color Pallet17. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data    Label in the Additional Properties. The Tree Map Chart can use 2    dimensions for which the data labels inside the containers will be    shown. As shown in Figure 4.238, you can configure the appearance of    the data label for each level individually.. figure:: _static/images/4.193.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.238: Tree Map Chart– Category Appearance18. Set the property Font Size to the value 10.19. Set the property Font Family to the option Default.20. Set the property Font Color to black.21. Set the property Font Style to the option Bold.22. Set the property Horizontal Alignment to the option Left.23. Set the property Vertical Alignment to the option Middle.24. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart    (see Figure 4.239)... figure:: _static/images/4.194.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.239: Tree Map Chart– Category Appearance25. In the area Data Series set the property Border Color to black.26. Set the property Border Width to the value 1.27. Set the property Border Style to the option Solid.28. Similarly, you can configure the different properties from the    different categories in the Additional Properties for the Tree Map    Chart.29. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.30. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.31. You will be able to view the Tree Map Chart based on the configured    properties (see Figure 4.240)... figure:: _static/images/4.195.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.240: Tree Map Chart32. The Tree Map Chart can use a maximum of 2 dimensions and we can    configure the Labels in regards to the Style for the two different    levels (see Figure 4.241)... figure:: _static/images/4.196.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.241: Category Appearance– Data Label33. Figure 4.242 shows the Tree Map chart configured with 2 levels of    labels... figure:: _static/images/4.197.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.242: Tree Map Chartwith two dimensionsTree Map CapabilitiesPlease note that in case if you require more than two dimensions beingpart of the Tree Map Chart we would recommend to take a look at the TreeMap Drill Down Chart (see section 4.14.19).Additional Properties of the Tree Map Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Propertiesfor all charts. In this section we will outline the AdditionalProperties that are specific to the Tree Map Chart... _category-data-7:Category Data^^^^^^^^^^^^^+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+| Sub category    | Area            | Property        | Description     |+=================+=================+=================+=================+| Data Series     | Chart Settings  | Select Measure  | Here you can    ||                 |                 | for Size        | set the measure ||                 |                 |                 | for the Size.   |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+|                 |                 | Minimum Value   | Sets the Color  ||                 |                 | Color           | for the Minimum ||                 |                 |                 | value.          |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+|                 |                 | Select Measure  | Here you can    ||                 |                 | for Color       | set the measure ||                 |                 |                 | for the Color.  |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+|                 |                 | Maximum Value   | Sets the Color  ||                 |                 | Color           | for the Maximum ||                 |                 |                 | value.          |+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+|                 |                 | Select Type of  | Sets the type   ||                 |                 | Color Scheme    | of color.

Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All supported scripting functions for the Tree Map Drill Down Chart arelisted as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed insection 4.6.Special Charts--------------In this category we will take a look at charts that do not fit into anyof the other categories. In this section we will discuss the followingchart types:-  Dual Axis Chart-  Multiple Axis Chart-  Super Combination Chart-  Sparkline Charts-  Sparkline Table Chart-  Tag Cloud Chart-  Waffle Chart-  Risk Matrix Chart-  Calendar Heat Map ChartDual Axis Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Dual Axis Chart provides an additional Y-Axis and allows you to plotmultiple sets of data as part of a single chart. For Example, whenmeasures like Actual Sales, Budgeted Sales, and Profit in % need to beplotted on a chart, Actual Sales and Budgeted Sales can be plotted onthe primary axes and the Profit values shown as a percentage can beplotted on the secondary axes... figure:: _static/images/4.211.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.256:Dual Axis ChartFigure 4.256 shows the Actuals in form of a Column and the Budget inform of a Line chart, both combined in a Dual Axis Chart... _order-of-displaying-different-chart-types-1:Order of Displaying Different Chart Types~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart in the category Dataand the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the“Series Order” for displaying the different chart types. By changing theSeries Order of the measure items, the order of display for the chartsand the order of legend for the measure items will be changed based onthe changed Series Order.For our example, in the additional properties of the Dual Axis Chart thedefault Series Order for the measure items is shown in Figure 4.257... figure:: _static/images/4.212.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.257: Default SeriesOrderBased on the above configuration, you will be able to visualize the DualAxis Chart being displayed with the default order of legend items andthe default order of display of the charts for the measure itemsDiscount Amount and Order Amount (see Figure 4.258)... figure:: _static/images/4.213.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.258: Default SeriesOrderFor our example, in the additional properties of the Dual Axis Chartchange the Series Order for the measure items Discount Amount and OrderAmount so that the order of legend items and the order of display of thecharts for those measure items will be changed (see Figure 4.259)... figure:: _static/images/4.214.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.259: Changed SeriesOrderBased on the above configuration, the Dual Axis Chart will be displayedwith the changed order of legend items and the changed order of displayof the charts for the measure items Discount Amount and Order Amount(see Figure 4.260)... figure:: _static/images/4.215.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.260: Changed SeriesOrderOption to have one Stacked Chart per Available Axis~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart in the category Dataand the sub category Data Series, the Stacked Chart types which areassigned to the measure items can be now mapped to more than one Y-Axis.For our example in the area Series Type, the measure Order Cost isassigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Discount Amount isassigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Order Quantity isassigned to the Column Stacked Chart type and measure Order Amount isassigned to the Column Stacked Chart type (see Figure 4.261)... figure:: _static/images/4.216.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.261: Series TypeIn the area Series Y-Axis, the measure Order Cost is assigned to the YAxis 2, measure Discount Amount is assigned to the Y Axis 1, measureOrder Quantity is assigned to the Y Axis 2 and measure Order Amount isassigned to the Y Axis 1 (see Figure 4.262)... figure:: _static/images/4.217.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.262: Series Orderand Series Y-AxisBased on the above configured settings on Series Type and Series Y-Axis,you can visualize the Dual Axis Chart (see Figure 4.263). You canobserve that the measures Discount Amount and Order Amount takes theplot values of Y-Axis 1 and the measures Order Cost and Order Quantitytakes the plot values of Y-Axis 2... figure:: _static/images/4.218.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.263: Series Y-AxisAdding Trendlines ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart in the category Dataand the sub category Trendline, you have the ability to add thetrendlines to the Dual Axis Chart similar to other Charts.For our example, activate the option Enable Trendline and assign theTrend Type as “Linear” and the desired Color for the Measure items OrderAmount and Order Cost (see Figure 4.264)... figure:: _static/images/4.219.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.264: EnableTrendlineBased on the above configuration, you can visualize the Dual Axis Chartwith the Trendlines assigned to the Measure items Order Amount and OrderCost (see Figure 4.265)... figure:: _static/images/4.220.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.265: Dual AxisChart with TrendlinesData Source Requirements for a Dual Axis Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Dual Axis Chart is a datasource with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one or more measuresin the Columns. In case the data source does contain additionaldimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility toolto specify which information is to be used by the Dual Axis Chart or youcan decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart.How to use the Dual Axis Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Dual AxisChart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a datasource with a dimension Product in the Rows and measures Revenue, Cost,and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined   previously.3. Add a Dual Axis Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Dual Axis Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series   (see Figure 4.266).26.. figure:: _static/images/4.006.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.6: Category Data 8.  In the area Series Type you can configure the type of visualization    for each of the Data Series in your chart. The available options    are: (see Figure 4.266)    -  Column    -  Column Stacked    -  Column Stacked Percent    -  Line    -  Spline    -  Area    -  Area Stacked    -  Area Stacked Percent    -  Area Spline    -  Area Spline Stacked    -  Area Spline Stacked Percent9.  In our example we are setting the following Series Type:    -  Measure Profit: Column Stacked Percent    -  Measure Costs: Column Stacked Percent    -  Measure Net Value: Column10. In the Series Y-Axis area of the Additional Properties you can    decide which measure is being plotted onto which axis in the chart    (see Figure 4.266)... figure:: _static/images/4.222.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.267: Dual Axis ChartAdditional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Propertiesoutlined in section 4.5 and the Additional Properties for the X-Axis,Y-Axis outlined in section 4.5.5.1, the Dual Axis Chart supports thefollowing Additional Properties... _category-data-9:Category Data^^^^^^^^^^^^^The category Data in the Additional Properties allows you to customizesettings in regards to topics such as Data Labels, Error Bar, Markers,and other data relevant configurations.+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+| Sub category    | Area            | Property        | Description

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Multiple Axis Chart provides the option to setup a chart with asmany axis as you have measures in the assigned data source, meaning youcould create a chart with an axis for each measure... figure:: _static/images/4.223.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.268:Multiple Axis ChartFigure 4.268 shows the Actuals in form of a Column, the Pre Budget andPost Budget measure in form of a Line chart and each measure has beenplotted against their own axis... _order-of-displaying-different-chart-types-2:Order of Displaying Different Chart Types~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart in the categoryData and the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the“Series Order” for displaying the different chart types. By changing theSeries Order of the measure items, the order of display for the chartsand the order of legend for the measure items will be changed based onthe changed Series Order.For our example, in the additional properties of the Multiple Axis Chartthe default Series Order for the measure items is shown in Figure 4.269... figure:: _static/images/4.224.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.269:Default Series OrderBased on the above configuration, the Multiple Axis Chart will bedisplayed with the default order of the legend items and the defaultorder of display of the charts for the measure items Discount Amount,Order Amount and Order Quantity (see Figure 4.270)... figure:: _static/images/4.225.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.270:Default Series OrderFor our example, in the additional properties of the Multiple Axis Chartchange the Series Order for the measure items Discount Amount and OrderAmount so that the order of legend items and the order of display of thecharts for those measure items will be changed (see Figure 4.271)... figure:: _static/images/4.226.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.271:Changed Series OrderBased on the above configuration, the Multiple Axis Chart will bedisplayed with the changed order of legend items and the order ofdisplay of the charts for the measure items Discount Amount and OrderAmount will be changed (see Figure 4.272)... figure:: _static/images/4.227.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.272:Changed Series OrderOption to have one Stacked Chart Type per Available Axis~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart in the categoryData and the sub category Data Series, Stacked Chart types which areassigned to the measure items can be now mapped to more than one Y-Axis.For our example in the area Series Type, measure Discount Amount isassigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Order Amount isassigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Order Cost isassigned to the Column Stacked Chart type and measure Order Quantity isassigned to the Column Stacked Chart type (see Figure 4.273)... figure:: _static/images/4.228.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.273:Series TypeIn the area Series Y-Axis, measure Discount Amount is assigned to the YAxis 4, measure Order Amount is assigned to the Y Axis 2, measure OrderCost is assigned to the Y Axis 3 and measure Order Quantity is assignedto the Y Axis 1 (see Figure 4.274)... figure:: _static/images/4.229.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.274:Series Y-AxisBased on the above configured settings on Series Type and Series Y-Axis,you can visualize the Multiple Axis Chart (see Figure 4.275). You canobserve that the measure Discount Amount takes the plot values of Y-Axis4, the measure Order Amount takes the plot values of Y-Axis 2, themeasure Order Cost takes the plot values of Y-Axis 3 and the measureOrder Quantity takes the plot values of Y-Axis 1... figure:: _static/images/4.230.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.275:Series Y-Axis.. _adding-trendlines-1:Adding Trendlines ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart in the categoryData and the sub category Trendline, you have the ability to add thetrendlines to the Multiple Axis Chart similar to other Charts.For our example, activate the option Enable Trendline and assign theTrend Type as “Linear” and the desired Color for the Measure items OrderAmount, Order Cost and Order Quantity (see Figure 4.276)... figure:: _static/images/4.231.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.276:Enable TrendlineBased on the above configuration, you can visualize the Multiple AxisChart with the Trendlines assigned to the Measure Items Order Amount,Order Cost and Order Quantity (see Figure 4.277)... figure:: _static/images/4.232.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.277:Multiple Axis Chart with TrendlinesData Source Requirements for a Multiple Axis Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Multiple Axis Chart is a datasource with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one or more measuresin the Columns. In case the data source does contain additionaldimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility toolto specify which information is to be used by the Multiple Axis Chart oryou can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart.How to use the Multiple Axis Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new MultipleAxis Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use adata source with a dimension Calendar Month in the Rows and measuresRevenue, Cost, and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the datasource.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined   previously.3. Add a Multiple Axis Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Multiple Axis Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series   (see Figure 4.278)... figure:: _static/images/4.233.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.278:Category Data 8.  In the area Series Type you can configure the type of visualization    for each of the Data Series in your chart. The available options    are:    -  Column    -  Column Stacked    -  Column Stacked Percent    -  Line    -  Spline    -  Area    -  Area Stacked    -  Area Stacked Percent    -  Area Spline    -  Area Spline Stacked    -  Area Spline Stacked Percent9.  In our example we are setting the following Series Type:    -  Measure Profit: Line    -  Measure Costs: Column    -  Measure Net Value: Column10. In the Series Y-Axis area of the Additional Properties you can    decide which measure is being plotted onto which axis in the chart    (see Figure 4.278). For our example we will plot each measure on its    own Axis (see Figure 4.279)... figure:: _static/images/4.234.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.279:Multiple Axis ChartAdditional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Propertiesoutlined in section and the Additional Properties for the X-Axis, Y-Axisoutlined in section 4.5.5.1, the Multiple Axis Chart supports thefollowing Additional Properties... _category-data-10:Category Data^^^^^^^^^^^^^The category Data in the Additional Properties allows you to customizesettings in regards to topics such as Data Labels, Error Bar, Markers,and other data relevant configurations.+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+| Sub category    | Area            | Property        | Description

Please note, that the SuperCombination chart provides one axis for the different measures... figure:: _static/images/4.235.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.280:Super Combination ChartData Source Requirements for a Super Combination Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Super Combination Chart is adata source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one or moremeasures in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additionaldimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility toolto specify which information is to be used by the Super CombinationChart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart.How to use the Super Combination Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new SuperCombination Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going touse a data source with a dimension Product in the Rows and measuresRevenue, Cost, and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the datasource.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined   previously.3. Add a Super Combination Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Super Combination Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Super Combination Chart.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series   (see Figure 4.281)... figure:: _static/images/4.236.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.281: Category Data 8.  In the area Series Type you can configure the Series Type for each    of the measure values visualized in the chart.9.  In addition you have the option to include an Average value by    enabling the property Enable Data Series Average.10. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart    (see Figure 4.282)... figure:: _static/images/4.237.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.282: Category Appearance11. In the area General Settings scroll down to the area Pie. Here you    can configure the placement and the size of the Pie Chart.Additional Properties of the Super Combination Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Propertiesfor all charts and in section 4.5.5.1 we outlined the AdditionalProperties for the X-Axis and the Y-Axis. In this section we willoutline the Additional Properties that are specific to the SuperCombination Chart... _category-data-11:Category Data^^^^^^^^^^^^^The category Data in the Additional

AppearanceScripting Functions for the Super Combination Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All supported scripting functions for the Super Combination Chart arelisted as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed insection 4.6.Sparkline Charts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Sparkline charts (see Figure 4.283) are a condensed form of a linechart (or bar chart, or area chart), where the focus is on the variationof the overall trend. The chart plot area has no axes, data labels,legends or title/sub-title... figure:: _static/images/4.238.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.283: SparklineChartThe Sparkline Chart component supports the following chart types:-  Area Chart-  Line Chart-  Column Chart-  Bar Chart-  Win Loss Chart-  Bullet ChartData Source Requirements for Sparkline Charts^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Sparkline charts do allow you to leverage dimensions and measures aspart of the rows and columns in the underlying data source but it isimportant to understand how sparkline charts will use the dimensions andmeasures in the rows and in the columns.Dimensions that are being placed into the Rows area of the initial viewof your data source will also be used as part of the rows of yoursparkline chart. In a situation where multiple dimensions are beingstacked in the Rows area, then those dimensions will be shown in therows of the sparkline chart and you will see a chart for each element ofthe rows.For dimensions or measures placed into the columns, the logic isslightly different. The first element – also being referred to as theouter element – being placed into the columns will be used to split thecolumns of the sparkline charts and the next element will be plotted inthe chart itself.To illustrate the logic, let us take a look at a quick example. For ourexample we assume that we have a data set containing dimension Countryand dimension Region in the rows and measure Revenue in the column... figure:: _static/images/4.239.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.284: SparklineChart-Scenario 1Figure 4.284 shows how such a data set could be used to visualize thesingle measure for those two dimensions in form of a sparkline barchart. Expanding on the previous example, we will now add dimensionCalendar Month to the columns, so that we have measure Revenue first anddimensions Calendar Month as the inner dimension in the columns... figure:: _static/images/4.240.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.285: SparklineChart-Scenario 2 Figure 4.285 shows how a Sparkline chart would show the Revenue brokendown by Calendar Month for the two dimensions in the rows.How to use the Sparkline Charts?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new set ofSparkline Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to usea data source with a dimension Product in the Rows, dimension CalendarMonth in the Columns, and measures Revenue and Cost in the Columns ofthe Initial View of the data source. In the Columns we have the Measuresas outer dimension and dimension Calendar Month as inner dimension.1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined   previously.3. Add a Sparkline Chart component from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Sparkline Chart component.5. Based on the data source structure, your Sparkline Chart component   should look similar to Figure 4.286... figure:: _static/images/4.241.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.286: Sparkline Chart6.

Component~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All supported scripting functions for the Sparkline Chart are listed aspart of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section 4.6.Sparkline Table Chart~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Sparkline Table enables you to build a Table whose columns can bedimension members, measure values, or embedded Sparkline charts. Allparts of the Table like Header, Data cells, etc can be customized by awide range of properties... figure:: _static/images/4.243.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.288: Sparkline TableChartFigure 4.288 shows an example of a Sparkline Table Chart combininginformation in form of simple measure columns – such as the columnIncome – as well as charts inside the Table, such as the Income perQuarter.Data Source Requirements for the Sparkline Table Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum requirements for the data source for a Sparkline Table Chartis a data source with at least one dimension and one measure. In casethe data source does contain additional dimension or additionalmeasures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify whichinformation is to be used by the Sparkline Table Chart or you can decideto plot the complete data set onto the chart.How to use the Sparkline Table Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new SparklineTable Chart. The Sparkline Table Chart allows you to add columns basedon Dimensions, columns based on Measures, and you can add columns whichwill display Sparkline Charts. In the next set of steps we will show thedetailed steps for each of those options. For our example we will assumethat we have a data source with the following elements:-  Dimension Product Group in the Rows-  Dimension Product in the Rows-  Dimension Calendar Month in the Columns-  Measure Revenue in the Columns-  Measure Profit in the Columns-  Measure Cost in the Columns1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined   previously.3. Add a Sparkline Table Chart component from the VBX Charts to your SAP   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Sparkline Table Chart component.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Sparkline Table Chart   Component.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Table   Definition (see Figure 4.289)... figure:: _static/images/4.244.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.289: Category Data 8. The Sparkline Table Chart starts with an empty definition. Click on   Add Column.The following steps will outline on how to add Dimension based column:1. Set the Column Type to the option Dimension (see Figure 4.290)... figure:: _static/images/4.245.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.290: DimensionColumn2. You can now enter a Column Header, define the Column Width, and   select which Dimension you would like to add as column to the   Sparkline Table.3. For our example we are using the following values:   -  Column Header: Product Group   -  Column Width: 25%   -  Select Dimension: Product Group   -  Dimension Display: Text4. After entering those details click Save to add the new column to the   Table (see Figure 4.291)... figure:: _static/images/4.246.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.291: New DimensionColumn5.

representation of text data. Tags in thechart are usually single words and the importance of each tag isrepresented by the size and color... figure:: _static/images/4.251.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.296:Tag Cloud ChartFigure 4.296 shows a sample Tag Cloud Chart for a list of products andtwo measures assigned to the size of the text and the color of the text.Data Source Requirements for a Tag Cloud Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum requirements for the data source for a Tag Cloud Chart is adata source with at least one dimension and two measures. In case thedata source does contain additional dimension or additional measures,you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information isto be used by the Tag Cloud Chart.You can follow these rules in regards to the data structure for a TagCloud Chart:-  The first dimension in the Rows will be used for the Text value.-  The first measure in the Columns will be used for the Font Size.-  The second measure in the Columns will be used for the Font Color.How to use the Tag Cloud Chart?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Tag CloudChart. For our example we will assume that we have a data source withthe following elements:-  Dimension Product in the Rows-  Measure Net Value in the Columns-  Measure Profit in the Columns-  Measure Cost in the Columns1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined   previously.3. Add a Tag Cloud Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Tag Cloud Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Tag Cloud Chart   Component.6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional   Properties.7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart   (see Figure 4.297)... figure:: _static/images/4.252.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.297:Category Appearance8. In the area General Settings you can configure the following   properties:   -  Dimension Value Display: Here you can choose between the Key,      Text, Key and Text, or Text and Key as display option for the      dimension members.   -  Tag Cloud Shape: Here you can choose between an Elliptic or a      Rectangular layout of the Tag Cloud Chart.   -  Minimum Color: Here you can select the color for the Minimum value   -  Maximum Color: Here you can select the color for the Maximum      value.9. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility   (see Figure 4.298)... figure:: _static/images/4.253.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.298:Category Data 10. In the Category Data you can configure the following properties:    -  Enable Data Utility Tool: In case you would like to specify other       Dimensions or Measures for the chart, you can enable the Data       Utility and then specify the elements for the chart.    -  Select Dimension: Here you can select the dimension that will be       used for the text value of the chart.    -  Measure for Font Size: Here you can specify the Measure that will       be used for the Font Size.    -  Measure for Font Color: Here you can specify the Measure that       will be used for the Font Color.    -  Select Aggregate Function: Here you can set the Aggregate       Function for the measure values.11. For our example we will use the following settings:    -  Enable Data Utility Tool: Activated    -  Select Dimension: Product    -  Measure for Font Size: Profit    -  Measure for Font Color: Costs    -  Select Aggregate Function: Sum12.

A Waffle chart is often used to visualizethe percentage share or achievement of a specific target value... figure:: _static/images/4.255.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.300: Waffle ChartData Source Requirements for a Waffle Chart^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The minimum data source requirement for a Waffle Chart is a data sourceat least two cell values, so that one cell selection would represent thevalue and the second value would represent the maximum value. Inaddition, the Waffle Chart can also leverage dimensions in the rows forthe Dimension Stacking feature.How to use a Waffle Chart ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new WaffleChart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP LumiraDesigner project.You can follow the steps below to configure the Waffle Chart:1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira   Designer.2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that   our data source shows two measure - Sales Amount and Forecast Amount-   and one dimension Product.3. Add a Waffle Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4. Assign the data source to the Waffle Chart.5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Waffle Chart (see Figure   4.301).6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the   Additional Properties.7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in   the Additional Properties of the Waffle Chart (see Figure 4.301). In   the area General Settings you can configure the type of Waffle Data   using the property Select Chart Type. You have the option to choose   between Percentage or Number. Percentage will represent the values as   actual percentages, even when the assigned values are of numeric   nature. Number will represent the assigned values as numeric values.For our example, you can set the property Select Chart Type to theoption Percentage (see Figure 4.301)... figure:: _static/images/4.256.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.301:Waffle Chart – Category Appearance 8.  Set the property Value Color to Orange for those boxes representing    the value.9.  Ensure that the property Display Empty Boxes is enabled, so that the    empty boxes will be displayed10. Set the property Empty Area Color to Grey for those boxes    representing the empty values.11. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of    the Additional Properties for the Waffle Chart (see Figure 4.302).    In the area Calculation you can configure the Waffle Chart using    Static Data, Dynamic Data and the option to setup a Calculation for    two measures. For our example, we will proceed with the option to    setup a calculation using two different dynamic data values.12. Ensure that the property Enable Calculation is activated (see Figure    4.302)... figure:: _static/images/4.257.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.302:Waffle Chart – Category Data 13. Click the button to set the property Select Measure 1 to a single    cell value selection from the data set.14. Once clicked, the Select Data dialog opens and you can select the    value for Measure 1 (see Figure 4.303)... figure:: _static/images/4.258.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.303:Data Select Dialog15. Click OK to close the Select Data dialog... figure:: _static/images/4.259.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.304:Waffle Chart – Category Data 16. Click the button to set the property Select Measure 2 to a single    cell value selection from the data set (see Figure 4.304).17. Once clicked, the Select Data dialog opens and you can select the    value for the property Measure 2 (see Figure 4.305)... figure:: _static/images/4.260.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.305:Data Select Dialog18. Click OK to close the Select Data dialog... figure:: _static/images/4.261.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.306: Waffle Chart –Category Data 19. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.20. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.21. Now you are able to view the Waffle Chart based on the percentage    calculated for the dynamic data values for the given two measure    values (see Figure 4.307)... figure:: _static/images/4.262.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.307:Waffle Chart with dynamic data for two measure values22. You can also configure the Waffle Chart with a feature called    Dimension Stacking. Dimension Stacking is used to represent the    percentage share of each member from a selected dimension as part of    the Waffle Chart.23. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of    the Additional Properties for the Waffle Chart.24. In the area Dimension Stacking activate the property Enable    Dimension Stacking (see Figure 4.308). To use Dimension Stacking,    you need to add a Data Source with at least one dimension in the    Rows... figure:: _static/images/4.263.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.308:Waffle Chart – Category Data 25. Set the property Select Measure to the option Sales Amount.26. With Dimension Stacking enabled you will then receive each dimension    member listed and you can assign a color per dimension member (see    Figure 4.308).27. Navigate to the menu Application • Save.28. Select the menu Application • Execute Locally.29. Based on the property configured, you will be able to view the    Waffle Chart with different colored boxes in a 10 x 10 Matrix form    representing the percentage level of the measure Sales Amount for    each Product (see Figure 4.309)... figure:: _static/images/4.264.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.309:Waffle Chart with Color - Dynamic Stacking You can also configure the Waffle Chart with an icon for each dimensionmember when using Dimension Stacking.In the area Dimension Stacking you can activate the option EnableStandard Icons to enable custom icons for eachDimension Member.(see Figure 4.310)... figure:: _static/images/4.265.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.310:Standard Icon for Dynamic Stacking30. Navigate to the menu Application • Save.31. Select the menu Application • Execute Locally.32. Based on the configuration, you will be able to view the Waffle    Chart with different icons representing the percentage share of the    measure Sales Amount for each Product (see Figure 4.311)... figure:: _static/images/4.266.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.311:Waffle Chart with Icon - Dynamic Stacking 33. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Icons of    the Additional Properties for the Waffle Chart. In the area General    Settings you can configure the icon related properties. For our    example, ensure that the property Enable Responsive Size is    activated (see Figure 4.312). When activated, the icons will resize    according to the overall size assigned to the Waffle Chart as part    of the dashboard... figure:: _static/images/4.267.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.312:Waffle Chart – Category Appearance34. In case you prefer to set the Icon size manually, you can use the    property Icon Size.35. You can use the property Chart Point Gap to configure the gaps    between the icons.36. Set the property Chart Point Radius to the value 1... figure:: _static/images/4.268.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.313: Waffle Chart –Category Appearance37. Activate the property Enable Standard Icons (see Figure 4.314).38. Navigate to the property Filled Icon Group. Here you can search from    a large set of prebuilt icons. For our example we will enter the    search term Phone.39. Icons matching the search term are shown. You can search from a    large set of prebuilt icons. For our example we will enter the    search for Phone.40. Set the property Filled Icon Color to the color Blue.41. Set the property Non-Filled Icon Color to the color Red42. Set the property Icon Alignment to the option Center... figure:: _static/images/4.269.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.314:Waffle Chart – Category Appearance43.

Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira    Designer.2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume    that our data source shows two measures – Probability and Impact -    and one dimension Risk.3.  Add a Risk Matrix Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.4.  Assign the data source to the Risk Matrix Chart.5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Risk Matrix Chart (see    Figure 4.318).6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the    Additional Properties.7.  Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series in    the Additional Properties of the Risk Matrix Chart (see Figure    4.318).8.  In the area Chart Settings you can configure the Risk Matrix Chart    with X and Y Axis Measures. For our example, set the property Select    X-Axis Measure to the measure Probability.9.  Set the property Select Y-Axis Measure to the measure Impact.10. Activate the property Enable Bubble Size in case you would like to    represent the Significance of the risk by assigning a measure from    the data source.11. When the property Enable Bubble Size is activated, you need to    assign a measure to the property Size. For our example, the option    is activated (see Figure 4.318) and the measure Impact is assigned.12. When the property Display Occurrences is activated, the number of    risks in each of the matrix categories will be shown as a numeric    value displayed in each of the squares... figure:: _static/images/4.273.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.318:Category Data 13. You can configure the axis scale for the X-Axis and Y-Axis to be    based on a Percentage assignment or an Absolute value assignment.    When selecting the option “Percentage”, you can assign percentage    values for the start and end values of each range of the axis. The    assigned percentages will then calculate the actual start and end    values for the ranges based on the assigned percentage values and    the assigned measures.14. When selecting the option “Absolute”, you have the option to assign    absolute start and end values for each range on the axis.15. For our example, set the property X-Axis and Y-Axis Range Type to    the option “Absolute” (see Figure 4.319 and see Figure 4.320)16. Based on the absolute values of the measure Probability and the    measure Impact, the Risk Matrix is configured.17. You can change the text for the labels based on your choice. For our    example, set the property Range 1 to the value from 0 to 1 (see    Figure 4.319 and see Figure 4.320).18. Set the property Range 2 to the value from 1 to 2.19. Set the property Range 3 to the value from 2 to 3.20. Set the property Range 4 to the value from 3 to 4.21. Set the property Range 5 to the value from 4 to 5... figure:: _static/images/4.274.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.319:Category Data .. figure:: _static/images/4.275.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.320:Category Data 22. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data    Label. Ensure that the property Enable Data Labels is activated (see    Figure 4.321).23. For our example, set the property Data Label Type to the option    Dimension.24. You can also set the property Data Label Measure and the three    different options for the Measure are-  X-Axis-  Y-Axis-  Z-Axis (Size).. figure:: _static/images/4.276.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.321:Category Appearance 25. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart    (see Figure 4.322). In the area Matrix Color you can configure the    size of the Risk Matrix chart. For our example, you can set the    property Select Matrix Size to the option 5x5.26. After you configured the size of the Risk Matrix, you need to    configure the Color Range. Based on the configured size of the Risk    Matrix – in our example 5x5 – you will have to configure color codes    for values from 1 to 25.27. For our example, Table 4.59 shows the Color code and Range value for    5x5 Matrix (see Figure 4.322)+--------+-------------+| Color  | Range Value |+========+=============+| Green  | 0 - 10      |+--------+-------------+| Yellow | 11 - 20     |+--------+-------------+| Red    | 21 - 30     |+--------+-------------+Table 4.59: Color Code and Range Values.. figure:: _static/images/4.277.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.322:Category Appearance28. Figure 4.323 shows the 5x5 matrix with color code assigned based on    the defined ranges... figure:: _static/images/4.278.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.323:5x5 Matrix with user defined color codes29. You can change the color of the bubble. For our example, set the    property Bubble Color to dark blue (see Figure 4.324)... figure:: _static/images/4.279.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.324:Category Appearance with Bubble Color30. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.31. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.32. Based on the configured properties, you will be able to view the    Risk Matrix Chart (see Figure 4.325)... figure:: _static/images/4.280.jpg:align: centerFigure 4.325:Risk Matrix
