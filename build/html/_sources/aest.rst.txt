Advanced Column Bar Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Advanced Column Bar Chart offers an intuitive way to compare any two
measures. In addition to comparing two measures, it also adds a
spotlight to the variance between these measures in terms of absolute
and percentage values. Negative or Positive variance is automatically
categorized as two series. This removes the need to add conditional
formatting to highlight the quality of variance.

Data Source Requirements for a Advanced Column / Bar Chart 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Advanced Column / Bar Chart
are at least one dimension and two measures to form a minimum of two
Data Series where the Chart can be configured only for two series. In
case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional
measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which
information is to be used by the Advanced Column / Bar Chart.

How to use the Advanced Column / Bar Chart? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Advanced
Column Bar Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Advanced Column / Bar
Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measures Order Cost, Order Amount and Order
   Quantity along a set of members of dimension Item Category.

3. Add a Advanced Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Advanced Column / Bar Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Advanced Column / Bar
   Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the
   sub category Data Series (see Figure 4.140).

Figure .: Category Data – Series Options

8.  In the area Series Options, you can change the color for the series.
    For our example, set the Series Order Cost to the color Orange.

9.  Set the Series Order Amount to the color Blue.

10. Since the Chart considers only the first two data series in the
    Columns of the Initial View you will be able to set the colors for
    the first two data series Order Cost and Order Amount.

11. By default, the Series Positive and Negative will have Green and Red
    colors. You can also change their colors based on your choice.

12. Now navigate to the area Series Name Change (see Figure 4.141)

Figure .: Category Data – Series Name Change

13. Set the Series Order Cost to the name Order Cost.

14. Set the Series Order Amount to the name Order Amount.

15. Set the property ∆PY to the name Var (restricted to 5 characters).

16. Set the property ∆PY% to the name Var% (restricted to 5 characters).

17. Now navigate to the area Shape Options (see Figure 4.142).

Figure .: Category Data – Shape Options

18. Set the property Deviation Shape to the option Square. The other
    options are Diamond and Circle.

19. Set the property Deviation Shape Color to the color Black.

20. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the subcategory Chart
    (see Figure 4.143).

Figure .: Category Appearance

21. Set the property Set the Chart Type to the option Column.

22. Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the
    Advanced Column Bar Chart (see Figure 4.144). Here you can observe
    that there are three layers where the bottom layer 1 represents the
    Column Bar Chart for the first two data series Order Cost and Order
    Amount against the dimension Item Category. In this case, you can
    observe that the column bar chart gets displayed based on the
    comparison of the two data series taken as measures. Also, the data
    label gets displayed for the data series having higher value. The
    middle layer 2 shows the vertical column bars representing the
    Variance value for the first two data series Order Cost and Order
    Amount calculated as Series 2 value (Order Amount) – Series 1 value
    (Order Cost). The positive variance value will be denoted in green
    color vertical bars and the negative variance value will be denoted
    in red color vertical bars (see Figure 4.144). The top layer 3 shows
    the thin vertical column bars with deviation shapes at its top. Here
    the Variance % value for the first two data series Order Cost and
    Order Amount is calculated as Series 2 value (Order Amount) – Series
    1 value (Order Cost) /Series 1 value (Order Cost) X 100. The
    positive variance percentage value will be denoted in green color
    vertical bars and the negative variance percentage value will be
    denoted in red color vertical bars (see Figure 4.144).

Chart Type Selections for Advanced Column Bar Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the additional properties of the Advanced Column Bar Chart in the
category Appearance and the subcategory Chart, you have different Chart
Type options that can be configured for the Advanced Column Bar Chart.
The options are Column, Column-Pin, Column-Stacked, Column-Deviation,
Bar, Bar-Pin, Bar-Stacked, Bar-Deviation and Line.

For our first example, set the property Set the Chart Type to the option
Column-Pin (see Figure 4.145).

Figure .: Category Appearance

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Advanced
Column Bar Chart configured as Column-Pin chart type (see Figure 4.146).
You can observe that bottom layer is configured with Column-Pin chart
type having the Primary Measure as Order Cost and Secondary Measure as
Order Amount.

Figure .: Column-Pin Chart Type

Here you can also change the Primary and Secondary Measure shapes for
the Column Pin chart type by navigating to the category Data and to the
subcategory Data Series (see Figure 4.147).

Figure .: Category Data – Shape Options

For our second example, navigate to the category Appearance and to the
subcategory Chart and set the property Set the Chart Type to the option
Column-Deviation (see Figure 4.148).

Figure .: Category Appearance

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Advanced
Column Bar Chart configured as Column-Deviation chart type (see Figure
4.149). You can observe that bottom layer is configured with
Column-Deviation chart type. Here the secondary measure Order Amount is
viewed as Column Bar Charts and the primary measure Order Cost will be
represented as the positive deviation bar in green color that occurs
inside the Column Bar Chart and the negative deviation bar in red color
that occurs on the top of the Column Bar Chart. You can also configure
with different chart types to view the Advanced Column Bar Chart.

In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Properties
for all charts. In this section we will outline the Additional
Properties that are specific to the Trend and Comparison charts.
