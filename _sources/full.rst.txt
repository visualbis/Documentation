Features of VBX Charts
----------------------

The VBX charts offer several detailed features that are not available
with the standard components in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer. In the following sections you can find detailed
information about these features.

Title and Subtitle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The title is by default displayed at the top of the chart, and an
optional subtitle can be shown beneath it. The title and subtitle can
also be moved using the available settings in the Additional Properties
in the categories Title and Subtitle.

Axes
~~~~

The X-Axis and Y-Axis are shown by default in all VBX charts, except the
Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Funnel / Pyramid Chart, and any of the
progression components. The axis labels, tick marks, and gridlines are
closely linked and change with every change to the scaling parameters.
The following sections outline the details for the axes formatting
options.

Axis Labels
^^^^^^^^^^^

The axis labels can be configured for the X-Axis as well as for the
Y-Axis and are either indicating a dimension member or the value for the
data series. You have the option to configure elements such as a Prefix
or Suffix as well as the option to stagger the axis labels in order to
improve the readability.

Ticks
^^^^^

Ticks are the lines placed along an axis to show either the different
values or to show the different dimension members. You can configure the
details, such as the Tick Interval, Tick Placement, and Tick Position in
the category for each of the axis in the Additional Properties. In
addition you have the option to enable major and minor ticks for the
chart.

Gridlines
^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the option to enable ticks for the axis, you can also
enable gridlines for the X-Axis as well as the Y-Axis. You can configure
elements, such as the gridline color, gridline style, and gridline width
for each of the axis of the chart. Minor and major gridlines are
available for the values axis, and major gridlines are available for the
dimension axis.

Tooltip
~~~~~~~

The tooltip appears when you will be hovering over a point in a data
series. By default the tooltip shows the value of the point and the name
of the data series. At design time, the dashboard developer also has an
option to enable a crosshair option, which displays a line connecting
the points with their corresponding axis.

Legend
~~~~~~

The legend will display the data series of the chart and display the
assigned color and symbol of the data series. You also have the option
to hide / unhide a data series by clicking on the element in the legend
itself.

Plot Bands and Plot Lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The VBX charts provide the option to enable a plot line and plot band
for both of the axis. A plot line or plot band provides you with the
option to highlight a specific area or to add a line for a specified
threshold value.

Plot lines and plot bands provide the option to define the color, label,
and the plot value/range. The lines and bands will always be in a 90
degree angle to the axis it is defined for. When a plot band/line is
used on the X- and Y-Axis at the same time, the plot band/line on the
Y-Axis will be shown in front, as seen in the example below (see Figure
4.2).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.002.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.2: Plot bands and Plot lines in VBX Charts
Panning and Zooming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Panning and Zooming area of the Additional Properties you have
the option to activate the zooming option for the X-Axis or Y-Axis. You
can use the mouse pointer and drag out a rectangle in the chart itself,
and the selected area will be used for zooming. Unlike pinch zooming,
you can't pan the zoomed area, but has to zoom out on a new area. On
touch devices, you can zoom by pinching in the chart area. On these
devices, you may also move the zoomed area by panning with one finger
across the chart.

3D Charts
~~~~~~~~~

All the pie chart variants included in the VBX charts support a 3D
option. For all these charts, the following options are available:

-  **Enabled**: This indicates whether the 3D option is enabled or not.
   The possible values are true or false

-  **Depth**: The total depth of the chart with a default value of 100.

-  **Alpha & Beta**: The angles to rotate the view of the chart along
   the X-axis and Y-axis respectively.

Export 
~~~~~~~

All of the charts in the VBX suite do allow you to export the chart, as
shown in Figure 4.3. The export feature supports the options to export
the chart as a PDF, PNG, JPEG, or SVG vector file, or to print the chart
directly. The dashboard designer has the option to enable or disable the
export and printing option as part of the Additional Properties of the
chart in the category Export.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.003.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.3: Export Module in VBX Charts
Exporting Charts

Since the export options uses server side scripting, an internet
connection is required to download the image or document.

Chart Style Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the Additional Properties each of the charts is offering
detailed formatting options for elements such as the chart background,
borders, plot areas, margin, padding, and so on. These details can be
found in each of the different categories of the Additional Properties
as well as in the category Appearance.

Layout and Positioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VBX Chart elements such as axis labels, data labels, legends, titles,
and the export button can be positioned horizontally and vertically -
relative to the top left corner - using the properties "Align" and
"Vertical Align". The "Align" option can have the values left, right,
and center. The Vertical Align property can have the values top, bottom,
and middle.

Plot Area, Margin, and Padding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The plot area of the chart is the area within the axis, where the data
series are plotted. In Figure 4.4 the plot area is shown as an orange
box. The margin options (Left Margin, Top Margin, etc) define the margin
between the chart plot area and the chart borders. The padding options
(Left Padding, Top Padding, etc) define the padding between the outer
area of the chart and all elements inside the chart area, such as data
labels and a legend.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.004.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.4: Plot Area, Margin and Padding in VBX Charts
Borders
^^^^^^^

For chart elements, such as data labels, labels, and the legend it is
possible to define border details as part of the Additional Properties.
The properties Border Width and Border Color can be used to define the
border details. In addition, the property Border Radius can be used to
enable curved edges.

Fonts
^^^^^

All layout elements of the chart that include text have a Style option
that allows setting text related properties such as Font Color, Font
Style, Font Size, and Font Family. In addition there is an option to
define a global override option and to select a global font for all
elements of the chart.

Animation
^^^^^^^^^

The property Animation provides you the option to activate the chart
animation for situations where something has changed in the chart. A
change in the chart could be the change of a dimension, a drill down, or
a scripted change of other chart properties. The default duration of the
animation is 500 ms.

Conditional Formatting for Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The charts as part of the Visual BI Extensions (VBX) allow you to define
a set of conditional formatting rules, allowing you to highlight
information displayed in the chart itself based on a variety of
conditions. You can define rules based on a comparison with a single
measure, with a measure calculation, or based on a target value
definition.

The following charts support the Conditional Formatting capabilities:

-  Pie Chart

-  Pie Drilldown Chart

-  Donut Chart

-  Semicircle Donut Chart

-  Funnel / Pyramid Chart

-  Line Chart

-  Column / Bar Chart

-  Column / Bar Drilldown Chart

-  Combination Chart

-  Stacked Column Bar Chart

-  Waterfall Chart

-  Scatter Plot Chart

-  Bubble Chart

-  Fixed Column Chart

   In the following sections we will outline the options to setup
   Conditional Formatting for the charts and provides examples for all
   three options to setup rules for this functionality.

Conditional Formatting based on a Single Measures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first option for the Conditional Formatting is the ability to define
rules based on a Single Measure. For our example we will assume that we
have a Data source which outlines measure Net Value along 12 months of a
year and we will use a Column / Bar Chart for our example (see Figure
4.5). In addition our data source also contains the measure Cost and
Profit.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.005.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.5: Column / Bar Chart
You can follow the steps below to configure Conditional Formatting based
on a Single Measure:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measure Revenue along 12 months of the
   dimension Calendar Month.

3. Add a Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Column / Bar Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the
   sub category Conditional Formatting (see Figure 4.6).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.006.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.6: Category Data 
8. Now click on Create Rule (see Figure 4.7).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.007.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.7: Conditional Formatting
9.  Enter a Rule Name for your Rule.

10. Set the Rule Type to the option Single Measure.

11. You can now define the other properties for the rule, following the
    details in Table 4.1:

|                                   | Comparison Value.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Comparison Value Type             | Depending on the configured       |
|                                   | options, the property Comparison  |
|                                   | Value will allow to enter a       |
|                                   | static value, or setup a dynamic  |
|                                   | cell selection, or select a       |

Conditional Formatting for Measures

Please note, that you can configure a conditional formatting based on
all measures in the underlying data source from the chart itself and not
just based on measures that are used in the chart itself.

Conditional Formatting based on a Measure Calculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second option for the Conditional Formatting is the ability to
define rules based on a Measure Calculation. For our example we will
assume that we have a Data source which outlines measure Net Value along
12 months of a year and we will use a Column / Bar Chart for our
example. In addition our data source also contains the measure Cost and
Profit.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Conditional Formatting
based on a Measure Calculation:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows the measure Revenue along 12 months of
    the dimension Calendar Month.

3.  Add a Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Assign the data source to the Column / Bar Chart.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.

6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

7.  In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to
    the sub category Conditional Formatting (see Figure 4.10).

8.  Now click on Create Rule.

9.  Enter a Rule Name for your Rule.

10. Set the Rule Type to the option Measure Calculation (see Figure
    4.10).

13. After configuring the details, please click Save. The rule will be
    added to the list and if required you can edit the details.

The configured Rule is now being applied to our chart and those values
in the chart, which meet the requirement of our defined rule, will be
color using colored green.

Conditional Formatting based on a Target Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The third option for the Conditional Formatting is the ability to define
rules based on a Target Value achievement. For our example we will
assume that we have a Data source which outlines measure Net Value along
12 months of a year and we will use a Column / Bar Chart for our
example. In addition our data source also contains the measure Profit.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Conditional Formatting
based on a Target Value:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows the measure Revenue along 12 months of
    the dimension Calendar Month.

3.  Add a Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Assign the data source to the Column / Bar Chart.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.

6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

7.  In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to
    the sub category Conditional Formatting (see Figure 4.12).

8.  Now click on Create Rule.

9.  Enter a Rule Name for your Rule.

10. Set the Rule Type to the option Target Value (see Figure 4.12).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.012.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.12: Measure Calculation
11. You can now define the other properties for the rule, following the
    details in Table 4.3:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Label                             | Details                           |
+===================================+===================================+
| Rule Name                         | Here you can enter a Name for the |
|                                   | Alert.                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Rule Type                         | You can choose between : Single   |

14. You can now enter the rules and per rule you can define the color.

15. After you finished the details, please click on Save to add the rule
    to the chart.

The configured Rule is now being applied to our chart and those values
in the chart, which meet the requirement of our defined rule, will be
colored following the detailed rules.

Conditional Formatting based on a Dimension Member
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fourth option for the Conditional Formatting is the ability to
define rules based on specific dimension member. For our example we will
assume that we have a Data source which outlines measure Net Value along
a set of Products and we will use a Column / Bar Chart for our example.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Conditional Formatting
based on a Target Value:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows the measure Revenue along a set of
    Products.

3.  Add a Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Assign the data source to the Column / Bar Chart.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.

6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

7.  In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to
    the sub category Conditional Formatting (see Figure 4.14).

8.  Now click on Create Rule.

9.  Enter a Rule Name for your Rule.

10. Set the Rule Type to the option Dimension (see Figure 4.14).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.014.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.14: Dimension
11. You can now define the other properties for the rule, following the
    details in Table 4.4:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Label                             | Details                           |

In this scenario the selected dimension members will be highlighted with
the defined color.

Configuring Identical Scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the Visual BI Extensions (VBX) for SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, you can now configure several charts with an
identical scale. This option is not available for charts with more than
one Y-Axis or for charts without an axis, like the Pie chart. For
Example, if one chart displays sales values and a second chart displays
Cost of Goods Sold, then by defining an identical Axis Group for the
Y-Axis in the Additional Properties, the dashboard designer can
configure both of the charts with a common scale (see Figure 4.15).
Following are the charts that support Identical Scaling:

-  Column/Bar chart

-  Combination chart

-  Fixed Column chart

-  Line chart

-  Scatter Plot chart

-  Stacked and Grouped Column chart

-  Stacked Area chart

-  Stacked Column/Bar chart

-  Super Combination chart

Once, two or more charts are assigned to an identical scale, all the
charts assigned to this group will have the Y-Axis configured with a
common scale. If the first chart shows Sales values between $5 Million
and $10 Million and the second chart shows Cost values between $1
Million and $6 Million, then both the charts will be normalized between
$1 Million and $10 Million.

To configure two or more charts with an identical scale, you can follow
the steps listed below:

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer navigate to
   the Additional Properties of the first chart.

2. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Y-Axis.

3. Navigate to the area Identical Scaling.

4. Enter a new name for the property Identical Scaling Group Name and
   click Add/Update.

5. Now select the newly created group from the property Select Group
   dropdown list.

6. Select the second chart in your project.

7. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Y-Axis for
   the second chart.

8. Navigate to the area Identical Scaling.

9. Select the previously created group from the property Select Group
   dropdown list (see Figure 4.15).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.015.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.15: Identical Scaling
By assigning the identical group to both charts, you assigned both
charts to an identical scaling and each time a change in scaling – for
example based on filter values – will automatically update both charts.

Displaying Totals/Sub-totals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our charts also provide an option to display the Total and Sub-Total
values as a separate column or bar. This option can be enabled as part
of the Additional Properties by navigating to the category Data and to
the sub category Data Series (see Figure 4.17). The sub-totals are
calculated as a summation of all data series for a particular dimension
member. The totals and subtotals will be shown as a separate category on
the X-Axis or Y-Axis (as shown in Figure 4.16).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.016.JPG
	:align: center
Figure 4.16: Example for displaying Totals/Sub-totals
Figure 4.16 shows a Column Chart outlining the sales revenue for several
products and by activating the option Show Totals the chart would also
include the Total Result values shown on the far right hand side for
each measure.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.017.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.17: Displaying Totals/Sub-totals
Displaying Key & Text for Dimension Member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the VBX charts are offering you the option to choose between the
Key, Text, or Key and Text values of the dimension members for the
display in the charts. The option to configure the display of the
dimension member is possible by navigating to the category Appearance
and to the sub category Chart and to the area General Settings (see
Figure 4.18). By default the charts will leverage the settings from the
Initial View of the assigned data source, but you have the option to
overwrite the configuration on a per chart basis.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.018.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.18: Displaying Key and Text
High Chart Theming Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the standard style properties you will also find the area
Chart Theme by navigating to the category Appearance and to the sub
category Chart of the Additional Properties (see Figure 4.19). The
dashboard designer can create a custom theme for the chart and in that
way quickly apply color settings and a defined look and feel to the
complete chart.

By clicking on the Custom Theme Editor, you will be guided to a separate
website (see Figure 4.20) and can configure the different elements of
the chart and then export the necessary theme code.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.019.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.19: High Chart Theming Support
You can follow the steps below to apply a custom theme to your chart:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a VBX Chart – for example a Column / Bar chart – to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

3.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

4.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
    and to the area Chart Theme (see Figure 4.19).

5.  Click on the link Custom Theme Editor to open the Custom Theme
    Editor (shown in Figure 4.20).

6.  In the Custom Theme Editor select the type of chart from the
    dropdown list in the top right corner.

7.  Select a theme from the pre-configured list of themes or customize
    the settings.

8.  The Custom Theme Editor lists several properties where you can
    modify the colors for elements such as chart background, Title,
    legend, data series, data labels, and tooltips. Change the colors of
    these properties as needed.

9.  Once the changes are done, click Export.

10. The custom code will be copied to the clipboard.

11. Navigate back to your dashboard in SAP BusinessObjects Design
    Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

12. Navigate to the Additional Properties.

13. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
    and to the area Chart Theme.

14. Now paste the custom theme code into the text area available in the
    Custom Theme Code.

15. Ensure the Enable Custom Theme option is activated.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.020.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.20: Custom Theme Editor
After applying the Custom Theme Code and enabling the Custom Theme
support for the chart, the configured color settings should now be
applied to your chart.

Support for Trendlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions for SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, most of the charts
also are now able to support Trendlines as part of the visualization.
Currently the supported Trendline types are: Linear, Exponential, and
Loess. You can find the Trendline option as part of the Additional
Properties for the chart by navigating to the category Data and to the
sub category Trendline (see Figure 4.21).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.021.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.21: Trendline
As shown in Figure 4.21, you can enable the support for the Trendlines
and you can choose for each individual measure which type of Trendline
you would like to add to the chart. In the example above we added linear
Trendlines for the measure Profit and Costs.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.022.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.22: Column Chart with Trendlines
Figure 4.22 shows the resulting Column chart with both Trendlines added
to the visualization. In case you would like to add Trendlines only to
some of the measure but not to all measures, you can use the entry
“None” from the dropdown box to not show a Trendline for some of the
measures.

Trendlines are currently supported by the following chart types: Area
chart, Bubble chart, Column / Bar chart, Line chart, Scatter Plot chart,
Stacked Area chart, Stacked Column / Bar chart.

Customizing Line Style and Marker Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions for SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, those charts that
offer the display options of lines and markers – for example a Line
chart – also provide the ability to customize those options. The options
to customize the Line Style and Marker Style can be done by navigating
to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series and to the area
Marker in the Additional Properties of the chart (see Figure 4.23).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.023.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.23: Line and Marker Options
Figure 4.23 shows the options to customize the Line Style and Marker
style for a measure and you can try having more than one measure. You
have the option to set a Line Style and customize the Marker Symbol,
Marker Size, and Marker Color.

Adding Error Bars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions our charts also
provide the option to add Error Bars to the display of the chart. Error
Bars can be used to provide an additional visual representation of the
variability of the data and are normally used on graphs to indicate the
error range.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.024.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.24: Error Bar Option
Figure 4.24 shows the detailed options for the Error Bar area by
navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Error Bar of the
Additional Properties.

-  **Error Amount**: The Error Amount can be set to Fixed Value,
   Percentage Value, Standard Deviation, or Custom. In case of the
   option Custom you will then have the option to first choose the Data
   Series and in addition you can then select measures from the data
   source for the upper and lower limits of the error bars.

-  **Error Amount Value**: In case of the Fixed Value or the Percentage
   Value option, you can enter the corresponding value.

-  **Stem Style**: You can leverage properties such as the Stem Width,
   Stem Color, and Stem Style to configure the look and feel of the
   Stem.

-  **Whisker Style**: You can leverage properties such as the Whisker
   Color, Whisker Length, and Whisker Width to configure the look and
   feel of the Whisker.

In case you choose the Custom option for the Error Amount you will
receive three additional configuration options:

-  **Select Measure**: Here you can select a measure from the data
   source and the Error Bar will be enabled for the selected measure.

-  **Upper Limit**: Here you can select a measure from the underlying
   data source as value for the upper limit of the Error Bar.

-  **Lower Limit**: Here you can select a measure from the underlying
   data source as value for the lower limit of the Error Bar.

Figure 4.25: Column Chart with Error Bars
Figure 4.25 shows a Column chart with a simple Error Bar display
configuration.

Editing Measure Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release 1.4 of the Visual BI Extensions you can now change
the labels for the measures being used as part of the chart. By default,
charts will use the label for the measure based on the meta-data
retrieved from the underlying source, but you can also customize the
label as part of the Additional Properties (see Figure 4.26).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.026.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.26: Series Name Change
Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series and to
the area Series Name Change. You can simply enter a new name for each of
the available measures and the chart will then use the changed name as
part of the visualization.

Configuring Drill Down for Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the VBX Charts you also receive a set of Drill Down charts,
which are able to leverage multiple dimensions or a hierarchy from the
assigned data source and provide your users with the ability to drill
down from an overview to a more detailed chart. In the following
sections we will outline the detailed options on how you can setup a
Drill Down chart either based on multiple dimensions or based on a
hierarchical data set. Drill Down charts either require multiple
dimensions as part of the data source or a dimension with an activated
hierarchy. In addition Drill Down Charts offer several advanced
features, which can be configured as part of the Additional Properties.
You will have the option to either perform an actual Drill Down, meaning
you will navigate to a more detailed chart, or you can choose to expand
the chart inplace. For our first example on how you can configure a
Drill Down Chart we will assume that our data source consists of
dimension Calendar Year and dimension Calendar Month as well as measures
Revenue and Cost.

You can follow the steps below to setup your first Drill Down Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a Column / Bar Drilldown chart to your SAP BusinessObjects Design
   Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

3. Add a data source to your project. For our example we assume the data
   source has dimension Calendar Year and Calendar Month, as well as
   measures Revenue and Cost.

4. Assign the data source to the chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View
   **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Drill Down (see
   Figure 4.27).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.027.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.27: Category Data 
8. In the sub category Drill Down you have several options to configure
   the Drill Down behavior. You can find the details in Table 4.5:

|                                   | grouped together based on the     |
|                                   | drill down.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Table 4.5: Data Series Properties

9.  For our example we will activate the following options:

    -  Show Parent Nodes on Drilldown

    -  Show all Measures

    -  Activate Hierarchical Labeling

10. For all other options we will use the default values, which means
    that you will be able to use a drill down with a double-click and
    the inplace Expand / Collapse option with a single-click.

11. Now use the menu Application **•** Execute Locally to see the chart
    and use the Drilldown.

12. Your initial view of the chart should look similar to Figure 4.28.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.028.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.28: Drilldown Chart
13. Now use a double-click on any of the columns in the chart (see
    Figure 4.29).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.029.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.29: Drilldown Chart
14. You can now see the next dimension based on the Drilldown and
    because we activated the option to see all measures, we can see
    measure Revenue and measure Cost. In addition we can see the parent
    node shown on the left hand side, in our example the node for the
    year 2014.

15. Click on the Back button in the top right corner to go back to the
    initial view.

16. Now use a single click on the measure for the year 2014 (see Figure
    4.30).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.030.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.30: Drilldown Chart
17. In this example we expanded the data to the next level. In our
    example we expanded the year 2014 to show the 12 members of
    dimension Calendar Month. In addition we can now see the
    hierarchical labeling showing the year and month labels in separate
    rows and we can also notice that the entry for the year 2015 is
    still visible because we used the inplace expand instead of the
    drilldown.

18. Close the browser and navigate back to SAP BusinessObjects Design
    Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

In the first example we used the Drill Down chart with a set of
dimensions. In our next example we will use the Drill Down chart with a
hierarchy from the assigned data source.

You can follow the steps below to setup your first Drill Down Chart with
a hierarchy:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a Column / Bar Drilldown chart to your SAP BusinessObjects Design
   Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

3. Add a data source to your project. For our example we assume the data
   source has dimension Product with an activated hierarchy, as well as
   measures Revenue and Cost along that hierarchy.

4. Assign the data source to the chart. You will notice that the chart
   does not display the hierarchical information, because we first need
   to activate the hierarchical drill down.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View
   **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Drill Down

8. In the area Hierarchy Drilldown, activate the option Enable Hierarchy
   Drill Down.

9. You will notice that the chart now shows the hierarchy from the
   underlying data source (see Figure 4.31).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.031.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.31: Hierarchical Drill Down Chart
10. You have the same options for the configuration (see Table 4.5) as
    well as navigation when you execute the application.

11. For the configuration in regards to the Drill Down we will use the
    default values, which means that you will be able to use a drill
    down with a double-click and the inplace Expand / Collapse option
    with the single-click.

12. Now use the menu Application **•** Execute Locally to see the chart
    and use the Drilldown.

13. Your initial view of the chart should look similar to Figure 4.31
    and you should be able to use a Drill Down as well as an inplace
    Expand / Collapse navigation.

In just a few steps we were able to use the Drill Down functionality of
the chart and use a set of dimensions and a hierarchy to visualize our
data.

Events
~~~~~~

In addition to the Additional Properties, the charts are also offering
the ability to add scripting code to specific events. The VBX charts
support the following events:

-  On Plot Background Click

-  After Chart Load

-  On Zoom

-  On Select

In addition, those charts that do support plot bands - such as the Trend
& Comparison charts - also support the following events in addition to
the events listed above:

-  On X-axis Plot Band Mouse Over

-  On Y-axis Plot Band Mouse Over.

Lasso and Reverse Lasso Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Lasso and Reverse Lasso selection allows you to either use a lasso
selection and select those elements in the chart that are included in
the selected area or to use a reverse lasso selection, which will select
all elements of the chart that are outside of the selected area. In the
following steps we will outline how you can leverage the Lasso and
Reverse Lasso selection with the Visual BI Extension charts.

Lasso Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the standard menu of the Visual BI Extension Charts you have
the option to select the Lasso option (see Figure 4.32). The Lasso
option will select those elements in the chart that are inside the
selected area. For our example, we will use a Column Chart with two
measures – Forecast Amount and Sales Amount – and several dimension
members.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.032.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.32: Lasso – Chart Menu
1. After you have activated the Lasso option from the chart menu, you
   can then select the elements in the chart (see Figure 4.33)– in our
   example the measures for dimension member Round Rugs and Curtains.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.033.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.33: Item Selection in chart
2. After you selected the items, the selected items will follow the
   color assignment for the selected items (see Figure 4.34) and the
   selected members can also be retrieved using the scripting functions
   for the chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.034.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.34: Lasso 
Reverse Lasso Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the standard menu of the Visual BI Extension Charts you have
the option to select the Reverse Lasso option (see Figure 4.35). The
Reverse Lasso option will select those elements in the chart that are
outside the selected area. For our example, we will use a Column Chart
with two measures – Forecast Amount and Sales Amount – and several
dimension members.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.035.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.35: Reverse Lasso – Chart Menu
1. After you have activated the Reverse Lasso option from the chart
   menu, you can then select the elements in the chart (see Figure 4.36)
   – in our example the measures for dimension member Round Rugs and
   Curtains.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.036.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.36: Item Selection in chart
2. After you have selected the items, the items outside the selected
   area will follow the color assignment for the unselected items (see
   Figure 4.37) and the unselected members can also be retrieved using
   the scripting functions for the chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.037.jpg

Figure 4.37: Reverse Lasso 
In the last section we have outlined the steps on you can leverage the
Lasso and Reverse Lasso selection with the Visual BI Extension charts.
In the next section, we will outline on the steps on you can enable /
disable a Loading message for the Visual BI Extension chart.

Ability to have a loading and hiding message via scripting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Show Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the chart functionality you have the option to enable /
disable a Loading message for situations, for example, where the chart
is loading a larger dataset. You can use scripting functions to trigger
the showing and hiding of the loading message.

You can follow the steps below for an example:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows two measures - Forecast Amount and Sales
    Amount – and one dimension Product.

3.  Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Make sure the Name of your Column Bar Chart in the Standard
    Properties is shown as CHART1.

5.  Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart.

6.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart.

7.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

8.  Navigate to the category Scripting in the Additional Properties of
    the Column Bar Chart.

9.  Open the script editor for the event After Chart Load.

10. Add the following scripting:

CHART1.DSXShowLoading();

11. Click OK to close the script editor.

12. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.

13. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

14. You will be able to view the loading message for the chart (see
    Figure 4.38).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.038.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.38: Loading Message
Hide Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the previous steps we enabled the loading message and in the next
steps we will incorporate the hiding of the message.

You can follow the steps below for an example:

1. Use the project we created in the previous steps with the loading
   message being shown when the chart is being loaded.

2. We will now add a button to the dashboard that will allow you to hide
   the loading message.

3. Ensure you have the previous project open in SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

4. Add a Button from the Basic Components to the canvas.

5. Ensure that the Button is being placed outside of the chart area, so
   that the button will not overlap with the loading message for the
   chart.

6. Navigate to the Standard Properties of the Button.

7. In case the Standard Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Properties to activate the display of the Standard
   Properties.

8. Open the script editor for the onClick.

9. Add the following scripting:

CHART2.DSXHideLoading();

10. Click OK to close the script editor.

11. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.

12. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

You will be able to view the chart and initially the loading message
will be shown and you have the option to click on the button to hide the
loading message (see Figure 4.39).

Master / Detail option for the charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the new Master Detail functionality for the Visual BI Extension
Charts you now have the option to enable a miniature display of the
complete chart and data for navigation purposes (see Figure 4.40).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.040.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.40: Master Details Chart 
Figure 4.40 shows an example of a Column Chart with the Master Detail
functionality enabled and you are now able to select a range of the
complete chart in the Master Details display, which then will focus the
chart on the selected area. This functionality is implemented for the
following charts:

-  Area

-  Bullet

-  Column Bar

-  Dual Axes

-  Fixed Column

-  Group Stacked Column Bar

-  Line

-  Multiple Axes

-  Stacked Area

-  Stacked Column Bar

The following steps show a simple example on how you can use the Master
Detail functionality:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows two measures - Forecast Amount and Sales Amount
   – and one dimension Product.

3. Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart from the Standard
   Properties (see Figure 4.41).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.041.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.41: Assign Data Source
5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.

6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

7.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
    and to the area General Settings. You can configure the Master
    Details for the chart.

8.  Enable the option Enable Master Detail (see Figure 4.42).

9.  You can then choose the Chart Type that you would like to use for
    the Master Details chart by setting the option Master Detail Chart
    Type.

10. In case you prefer to see the Axis for the Master Detail chart you
    can enable the option Enable Master Detail Axis.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.042.jpg

In the last section we have outlined the steps on how you can enable a
miniature display of the complete chart and data for navigation purposes
using Master Detail functionality in the Visual BI Extension chart.

In the next section, we will outline on how we will be working with the
New Context Menu for the charts.

Context Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Context Menu for charts now allows you to perform specific actions
as part of a context menu directly in the chart. You will have the
ability to leverage functions, such as filtering, ranking, drill down /
drill up, or selecting the dimensions and measures for display in the
chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.045.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.45: Category General
Figure 4.45 shows the sub category Context Menu as part of the
Additional Properties for the chart. As part of the Additional
Properties you can choose, which functionality will be available as part
of the Context Menu, and which functionality will be disabled.

Enabling the Context and Actions Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the category Context Menu you can enable / disable the
Context Menu using the property Activate Context Menu and the Actions
Menu using the Enable Actions Menu option (see Figure 4.45). After you
have enabled the Context Menu, you can open the context menu as part of
the dashboard at runtime using a right-click and you can open the
Actions Menu in the top right corner of the chart (see Figure 4.46).

Please also keep in mind, that when the Actions Menu is enabled, the
typical Export menu is disabled and the Export options are being
integrated into the Actions Menu.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.046.jpg

Figure 4.46: Enabled Context Menu
Enable Maximize Option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The property Enable Maximize Option allows you to maximize the chart.
When you maximize the chart, the chart will leverage the full screen
space that is available, and when minimized again, the chart will
leverage the configured space as part of the overall dashboard. Figure
4.47 shows the full screen space for the chart when maximize option is
enabled.

Enable Display Data Option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The property Enable Display Data Option allows you to display the chart
data in a separate window that shows the data in form of a table. In
case no element of the chart is selected, then the table will display
the complete data source. In case elements of the chart have been
selected, then the data for the selected elements will be shown in the
table. You need to click the grid icon and view the Table format for the
selected element (see Figure 4.49).

Ranking 
^^^^^^^^

The Context Menu Ranking allows you to rank the information in the chart
based on predefined conditions, such as Top 5, Top 10, Bottom 5, Bottom
10, or to use the option Top N or Bottom N to define a custom ranking
based on the available measures.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.055.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.55: Top 5 Ranking
Swap With
^^^^^^^^^

The Context Menu Swap With allows you to exchange the current dimension
used by the chart with another dimension from the assigned data source
(see Figure 4.56) and in that way quickly change the dimension used by
the chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.056.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.56: Swap from Continent to Region
Dimension Display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Context Menu Dimension Display allows you to choose, which elements
of a dimension will be displayed. You can choose between Key, Text, or a
combination of Key and Text values, as well as the option Default. The
option Default will leverage the configuration from the Initial View of
the data source (see Figure 4.57).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.057.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.57: Dimension Display
Select Measure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Context Menu Select Measure (see Figure 4.58) allows you to choose
which measure(s) will be displayed as part of the chart. By default, the
chart will display those measure which have been configured for the
chart as part of the initial design, but by using the Context Menu you
have the option to choose other or additional measures.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.058.jpg
	:align: center

In the Additional Properties category CSS (see Figure 4.73) you have the
option to retrieve the complete list of used style sheet classes. The
list of CSS Classes provides two functionalities. Using the Copy
functionality (see Figure 4.74), you can copy the settings of a single
style sheet class and paste the settings into the Style Sheet editor
inside from SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio / SAP Lumira Designer and
then change any settings for the used CSS class.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.074.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.74: Copy CSS Class
Using the Export CSS option (see Figure 4.73) you can export all used
CSS classes with all used settings into an external file and then copy
those configurations and paste them into the style sheet editor inside
SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio / SAP Lumira Designer. In addition you
have the ability to choose between different CSS templates, such as
Fiori, Belize, and Blue Crystal.

Style by CSS

Please be aware, that when the option Enable Style by CSS is activated,
that the settings done via the CSS will apply to any Visual BI Chart
used as part of the dashboard.

In addition, any settings configured via the CSS will overwrite the
configuration done as part of the Additional Properties settings.

Conditional Formatting in Charts using Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release 2.3 of the Visual BI Extensions for SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, most of the charts
also are now able to support Conditional Formatting using Logical
Operators OR and AND. You can find this option as part of the Additional
Properties for the chart by navigating to the category Data and to the
sub category Conditional Formatting.

For illustration part, you can follow the steps to configure a new Gantt
Resource Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project (see section 7.2.6):

    visualize the Gantt Chart using the logical OR operator for both the
    Rule 1 and Rule 2 (see Figure 4.96).

.. figure:: _static/images/OR7.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.96: Gantt Chart using Logical OR operator
25. Here you can observe that the Progress values for both the Rule 1
    and Rule 2 will be displayed in the Gantt Chart (represented by red
    color) based on the conditions “greater than 50” and values “between
    50 and 60”.

26. Based on the above set of configurations, when logical operator AND
    is applied for the Rule 1 and Rule 2, then you can observe that the
    Progress values in the Gantt Chart (represented by red color in
    Figure 4.97) will be visualized satisfying both Rules which denotes
    that it considers all the values above 50 (Rule1) and within the
    range from 50 to 60 (Rule 2).

.. figure:: _static/images/OR8.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.97: Gantt Chart using Logical AND operator  
Rule Type Selection

After creating a Group, if you set the property Rule Type to the option
as “Target Value” for Rule 1, then additional Rules cannot be created
further for that Group. If the property Rule Type for Rule 1 is set to
other options namely Single Measure, Measure Calculation and Dimension,
then additional Rules can be created for that Group.

Working with Data
-----------------

In the following sections we will outline a set of steps in SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer which will help you to
get a better understanding on how the VBX charts are able to leverage
the data as part of your next project in SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

Assigning a Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of the VBX charts will require a connection to a data source as
part of the SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
project. To add a data source to your SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project you can use a right click on the Data
Source folder in the Outline of your project and select the menu Add
Data Source (see Figure 4.98).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.076.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.98: Adding a Data Source
In the pop up window as shown in Figure 4.99 you can first select a
Connection and after doing so you can browse for a Data Source. After
you selected the Data Source you can specify an Alias for the data
source, which will be used as reference to the data source throughout
your application. You can confirm the dialog using the OK button.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.077.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.99: Specify Data Connection and Data Source
To edit the default view of the data source, right click on the newly
added data source in the Outline of your SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer application and select the meu option Edit
Initial View… as shown in Figure 4.100.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.078.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.100: Edit Initial View
The Initial View Editor (see Figure 4.101) allows to select rows,
columns, and filters for the view of your data source as well as
configuring properties such as a scaling factor for a measure. By
default, all the dimensions and measures added to the Rows, Columns, and
Background Filter will be used when the data source is being assigned to
a component.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.079.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.101: Edit Initial View
After the data source has been added to the SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project, it can be assigned to the charts
from the VBX suite. You can assign the data source to a component using
the property Data Source (see Figure 4.102) or using a simple drag and
drop navigation, dragging the data source from the Outline to the
component in your project.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.080.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.102: Data Source Selection
Data Utility Feature in VBX Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of the charts in the VBX suite also comes with the option to enable
the Data Utility tool (see Figure 4.103). The Data Utility functionality
provides you with the ability to select a subset of dimensions and
measures from the assigned data source for the chart. For example, your
data source could contain the dimensions Product Category and Region,
and the measures Sales Amount and Profit Amount, but your chart is
supposed to only display the Sales Amount by Region. In this situation
the Data Utility allows you to re-use this data source and select the
dimensions and measure that should be used, instead of using the
complete data set. As the Data Utility tool allows you to specify the
dimensions and measures per chart, it helps you to reduce the overall
number of data source and in that way helps you to improve the overall
performance of your application.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.081.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.103: Data Tab – VBX Charts  
Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility in
the Additional Properties of the VBX Charts (see Figure 4.103). After
you enabled the Data Utility tool by activating the option Enable Data
Utility Tool, you can set the Data Source Definition type and select
both the measures and dimensions (see Figure 4.104). All Dimensions that
are available in the Rows and Columns of the initial view are shown as
part of the Rows, Columns, and Measures area of the Data Utility tool.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.082.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.104: Data Utility box
Data Source Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the Data Utility tool, you have the option to configure the
property “Data Source Definition” to be based on the Technical ID or to
be based on the Index.

-  The option Technical ID allows you to specify the dimensions and
   measures based on their technical names.

-  The option Index Based allows you to specify an index value (zero
   based index), and the index will specify the position of the
   dimension or measure in the assigned data source. For example a index
   of 2 for the measure will then use the third measure (0, 1, 2) of the
   assigned data source. By using the option Index based, you can keep
   the dimension and measure assignment dynamic, as the Data Utility
   will then always leverage the dimensions and measures based on the
   assigned index, even when there are changes in the underlying
   structure of the data source.

For our example we will select the option “Technical ID” as shown in
Figure 4.105. The dimension Region is selected, along with the measures
Profit and Net Value.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.083.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.105: Data Utility
You also have the option to set the following properties for the Data
Utility (see Figure 4.105).

-  Include Result from Data Source: This property allows you to include
   Totals and Subtotals from the Initial View of the Data source.

-  Include Result: When this property is activated, you have the option
   to include totals / subtotals for the selected dimension / measures
   and choose the aggregation function in the next property.

-  Measure Aggregation: Using this property, you can configure the
   aggregation function for the totals / subtotals. The available
   options are: Min, Max, Average, Count, Distinct Count, Sum,
   Percentage Share, and Running Total.

-  Suppression Type – This property allows you to configure a Zero and
   Null suppression for the Rows and Columns. The Zero / Null
   Suppression will be performed on the configured element of the Data
   Utility Tool.

Common Properties of VBX Charts
-------------------------------

The following sections outlines the common properties of the VBX Charts
that are available in the Additional Properties. Properties that are
specific to a particular chart component are discussed separately.

General
~~~~~~~

The General category lists the component name and type which are not
customizable. The property Visible controls the visibility of the
component dynamically.

Data Binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dashboard designer can use the Data Source property in the Standard
Properties of the chart to assign a data source to the chart. In
addition you can leverage the previously mentioned Data Utility tool.

Display
~~~~~~~

The CSS Class property in the Standard Properties allows you to specify
the CSS class name that is added to the component at runtime. This class
can be referenced using the custom CSS file from the application
properties.

Layout
~~~~~~

Properties related to the component margins and size are available under
the Layout category in the Standard Properties. For any component, a
maximum of two properties between margins and size can be set to auto
for the component to adjust the size and position dynamically.

Additional Properties Sheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Additional Properties sheet consists of options and attributes to
control the look and feel of the VBX charts. This sheet also enables
users to modify properties related to advanced interactivities such as
drilldown, panning and zooming, etc. Figure 4.106 highlights the
available tabs of an Additional Property sheet for a line chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.084.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.106: Additional Properties - Tabs
Except for a few unique properties for specific charts (like gauges and

Trend and Comparison Charts
---------------------------

The VBX Suite consists of a group of chart components that highlight
trends over time or are used to compare elements among each other.

Trend and Comparison Charts Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the list of charts in the VBX suite, you also receive a set
of Trend and Comparison Charts. This group includes the following
charts: Line Chart, Column / Bar Chart, Combination Chart, and Area
Chart. In the following sections we will outline the details for each of
these chart types.

Line Chart 
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Line Chart is represented by a series of values connected with a
straight line. Line Charts are most often used to visualize data that
changes over time to indicate a potential trend. The Line Chart in the
VBX suite also has an option to indicate the trend as a spline (smoothed
line) instead of a standard straight line. A sample line chart is shown
in Figure 4.107.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.085.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.107: Line Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Line Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Line Chart are at least one
dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain
additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data
Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Line
Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart.

How to use the Line Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Line
Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Line Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measures Revenue and Cost along 12 months
   of the dimension Calendar Month.

3. Add a Line Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Line Chart.

5. The Line Chart will plot the information from the assigned data
   source (see Figure 4.108).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.086.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.108: Line Chart
Figure 4.108 shows the basic Line Chart for two measures. You can use
now the Additional Properties to customize the layout and look and feel.

Column / Bar Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Column / Bar Chart component is similar to a Line Chart, except that
the information is visualized either as columns or as bars. Figure 4.109
shows a sample column chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.087.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.109: Column / Bar Chart
Option for Runtime Deviation Bar in Column Bar Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart in the category
Appearance and the sub category Chart, you have the option to activate
the property Enable Deviation Bar to display the Deviation Value between
one Column Bar and the other Column Bar. The deviation will be
represented through a thin line bar showing the positive deviation in
green color and the negative deviation in red color.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the
Deviation Bar in the Column Bar Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measure Order Quantity along the dimension
   Item Category.

3. Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects/SAP Lumira Designer.

4. Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and
   to the sub category Chart (see Figure 4.110).

8. Activate the option Enable Deviation Bar (see Figure 4.110).

.. figure:: _static/images/run1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.110: Enable Deviation Bar
9. Based on the above configured settings, you will be able to visualize
   the Column Bar Chart enabled with Deviation Bar (see Figure 4.111).
   In our example, you can observe that a positive Deviation Order
   Quantity value of 93104 occurs for the dimension Movies in comparison
   with the dimension Books. The deviation will be calculated as Mouse
   Hover Column Bar Value Minus (-) Selected Column Bar Value. In our
   example, the Mouse Hover Column Bar takes the Dimension “Movies” and
   the Selected Column Bar takes the Dimension “Books”.

.. figure:: _static/images/run2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.111: Column Bar Chart with Runtime Deviation Bar
10. Now navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category
    Chart (see Figure 4.112).

11. Activate the option Deviation as % (see Figure 4.112).

.. figure:: _static/images/run3.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.112: Enable Deviation as %
12. Based on the above configured settings, you will be able to
    visualize the Column Bar Chart enabled with the option Deviation as
    % (see Figure 4.113). In our example, you can observe that a
    positive Deviation Order Quantity value of 48.74% occurs for the
    dimension Movies in comparison with the dimension Books. The
    deviation will be calculated as Mouse Hover Column Bar Value Minus
    (-) Selected Column Bar Value Divide (/) by Selected Column Bar
    Value x 100. In our example, the Mouse Hover Column Bar takes the
    Dimension “Movies” and the Selected Column Bar takes the Dimension
    “Books”.

.. figure:: _static/images/run4.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.113: Column Bar Chart with Runtime Deviation Bar in %
Deviation as %

The option Deviation as % will be only functional when the option Enable
Deviation Bar is enabled in the Additional Properties of the Column Bar
Chart.

Option to enable Pareto Series in Column Bar Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart in the category
Appearance and the sub category Chart, you have the option to activate
the property Enable Pareto Series to display both Column bars and a Line
where individual values are represented in descending order by column
bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line.

The Column Bar Chart with Pareto Series is useful for figuring out the
most significant factors in your data and how they contribute to the
entire set. Also, you can discover the areas for improvement from the
Pareto Series. For our example, you can follow the steps below to
configure the Pareto Series in the Column Bar Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measure Number of Mobile Phone Returns
   along the dimension Return Reasons.

3. Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Column Bar Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column Bar Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and
   to the sub category Chart (see Figure 4.114).

8. Activate the option Enable Pareto Series (see Figure 4.114).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.088.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.114: Enable Pareto Series
Based on the above configured settings, you will be able to visualize
the Column Bar Chart enabled with Pareto Series (see Figure 4.115). In
our example, you can observe the following:

-  The Pareto line starts at the center of the Defect category and
   intersects the right vertical axis at 40 percent, meaning Defects
   account for 40 percent of all Mobile Phone returns.

-  Moving along the Pareto line, the next stop is the center of
   Incorrect Pricing. The Pareto line at Incorrect Pricing intersects
   the contributing percentage axis at 70 percent, which means that the
   combination of Defects and Incorrect Pricing account for 70 percent
   of all Mobile Phone returns.

-  One more category over, Wrong Product intersects the Pareto axis a
   little bit above 80 percent, which means 80 percent of all Mobile
   Phone returns are a result of Defects, Incorrect Pricing and Wrong
   Product.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.089.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.115: Column Bar Chart with Pareto Series
Now you can discover the areas for improvement where the Mobile Phone
Store should allocate its efforts. Targeting improvements to Defects and
Incorrect Pricing are more worthwhile than adjusting the prices
(Expensive) or Quality of Mobile Phones (Poor Quality).

Data Source Requirements for a Column / Bar Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Column / Bar Chart are at
least one dimension and one measure. In case the data source does
contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage

   data source (see Figure 4.117).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.091.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.117: Sample Bar Chart
You can now customize the display of the chart using the available
settings in the Additional Properties.

Combination Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The combination chart allows you to combine a line chart and a column
chart into a single chart with a single axis. A sample combination chart
is shown in Figure 4.118.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.092.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.118: Combination Chart
Order of Displaying Different Chart Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the Combination Chart in the category
Data and the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the
“Series Order” for displaying the different chart types. By changing the
Series Order of the measure items, the respective legend for the measure
items will be changed based on the changed Series Order.

For our example, in the additional properties of the Combination Chart
the default Series Order for the measure items is shown in Figure 4.119.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.093.jpg

Data Source Requirements for a Combination Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Combination Chart are at least
one dimension and two measures. In case the data source does contain
additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data
Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the
Combination Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto
the chart.

How to use the Combination Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new
Combination Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Combination Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows three measures: Revenue, Cost, and Profit along
   a set of members of dimension Product.

3. Add a Combination Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Combination Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Column / Bar Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the
   sub category Data Series (see Figure 4.123).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.097.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.123: Category Data 
8. In the area Series Type you are presented with the option to choose
   the Series Type for each of the data series from the assigned data
   source. You can choose between the following options:

   -  Column

   -  Column Stacked

   -  Line

   -  Spline

   -  Area

   -  Area Stacked

   -  Area Spline

   -  Area Spline Stacked

9. For our example we will configure measure Revenue as Column, measure
   Cost as Column, and measure Profit as a Line (see Figure 4.124).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.098.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.124: Combination Chart
Number of Axis

Please note, that the Combination Chart is using a single Axis to plot
the different data series values. In case you prefer to use two or more
Axis we recommend to use the Dual Axis or the Multiple Axis chart.

Area Chart
~~~~~~~~~~

An Area Chart is a line chart that displays quantitative data and where
the area below the line is being filled with one color (see Figure
4.125). Area charts depict a time-series relationship, but unlike Line
Charts, Area Charts can also visually represent volume.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.099.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.125: Area Chart
Figure 4.125 shows a sample Area Chart with measure Sales along the 12
months of dimension Calendar Month.

Data Source Requirements for an Area Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for an Area Chart are at least one
dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain more
information, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which
information is to be used by the Area chart or you can decide to plot
the complete data set onto the chart. In case the data source contains
more than a single measure, the order of the measures in the initial
view of the data source then decides the order of plotting the measure
onto the chart.

How to use the Area Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Area
Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Area Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measures Revenue and Cost along 12 months
   of dimension Calendar Month.

3. Add an Area Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the chart.

5. After the data source has been assigned, the chart plots the members
   of the dimension for the X-Axis and the measure values are plotted as
   area (see Figure 4.126).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.100.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.126: Sample Area Chart
6. The area between the axis and the line is filled with the selected
   color based on the configuration in the category Data for each of the
   Data Series.

7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
   the Additional Properties of the chart.

8. Using the property Select Chart Type you can choose between:

   -  Area: This is a classic vertical Area chart with the value axis
      (Y-Axis) being on the vertical axis.

   -  Area Horizontal: This is a horizontal Area chart with the value
      axis (X-Axis) being on the horizontal axis.

   -  Area Spline: The Area Spline chart uses a smoothed line (spline)
      with the values axis (Y-Axis) on the vertical axis.

   -  Area Spline Horizontal: The Area Spline Horizontal chart uses a
      smoothed line (spline) with the values axis (X-Axis) on the
      horizontal axis.

9. You can enable Markers and customize the display of the Markers in
   the area Marker of the category Data. You can customize the Marker
   Symbol, Size, and Color.

Order of Display

In case you are planning to visualize multiple measures in an Area
Chart, please note that the first measure in the data source will be the
measure being displayed first and any additional measure will be
displayed in front of the first measure. The display order of the
measures is (assuming measures are organized in columns) from left to
right.

Column / Bar Drill Down Chart 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Column / Bar Drilldown Chart is an enhanced version of the Column /
Bar Chart. The additional feature is the ability to drill down from the
initial view into a more detailed chart. The drill down can be based on
a set of dimensions or it can be based on an available hierarchy
provided by the data source.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.101.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.127: Column Drilldown Chart
Figure 4.127 shows the initial view of a Column Drilldown chart with the
measures Revenue and Cost for the years 2014 and 2015. You can now use a
double-click on the elements of the chart and drill down to the next
level, which would show the 12 months for the selected measure (see
Figure 4.128).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.102.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.128: Drilldown Chart
You always have the option to use the Back navigation in the top right
corner to navigate back to the initial view.

Data Source Requirements for an Column / Bar Drilldown Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Column / Bar Drilldown Chart
are at least two dimensions and one measure or an active hierarchy and
one measure. In case the data source does contain more information, you
can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be
used by the Column / Bar Drilldown chart or you can decide to plot the
complete data set onto the chart.

How to use the Column / Bar Drilldown Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Column /
Bar Drilldown Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Area Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source has a dimension Year and a dimension Month as well as
   a set of measures.

3. Add a Column / Bar Drilldown Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the chart.

5. After the data source has been assigned, the chart will use the first
   dimension for the initial view and second dimension for the first
   drill down.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.103.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.129: Sample Drill Down Chart 
6.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

7.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
    Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
    Properties.

8.  Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Drill Down.

9.  In the area General Settings and in the area Hierarchy Drill Down
    you have several options to configure the Drill Down behavior. You
    can find the details in Table 4.5.

10. For our example we will activate the following options

    -  Show Parent Nodes on Drill Down

    -  Show all Measures

    -  Activate Hierarchical Labeling

11. For all other options we will use the default values, which means
    that you will be able to use a drill down with a double-click and
    the inplace Expand / Collapse option with a single-click.

12. Now use the menu Application • Execute Locally to see the chart and
    use the Drilldown.

13. Your initial view of the chart should look similar to Figure 4.129
    and you should be able to use a double-click for a Drilldown and a
    single click for an inplace Expand / Collapse.

Hierarchical Drill Down

Please note, that there is no need to expand the hierarchy in the
initial view of the data source and that there is no limit in number of
levels that can be used as part of a hierarchical drill down.

Radar Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~

A Radar chart allows you visualize the values of one or more measures
along several members of a dimension and instead of arranging those
value as columns or bars, those values are arranged radially around a
point. For example, Radar Charts can be effectively used in comparison
between two or more products over a range of characteristics to
determine its features.

Figure 4.130 shows a sample Radar Chart outlining the measure values
long 12 months and comparing multiple regions.

The Radar Chart provides four different versions of the Radar Chart:

-  Radar Chart

-  Radar Filled Chart

-  Radar Column Chart

-  Radar Column Stacked Chart

Data Source Requirements for a Radar Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Radar Chart are at least one
dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain
additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data
Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Radar
Chart.

You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a
Radar Chart:

-  Each Dimension or Measure placed into the Rows of the Initial View of
   the Data Source will be used for the outer Axis of the Radar chart.

-  Each Dimension or Measure placed into the Columns of the Initial View
   of the Data source will be used as a data series represented in form
   of a line in the Radar Chart.

How to use the Radar Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Radar
Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Radar Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measures Net Value, Cost, and Profit in the
   Rows of the Initial View and dimension Product in the Columns of the
   Initial View.

3. Add a Radar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Radar Chart.

Slope Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~

Slope Charts are perfect for highlighting the story of how just one
category decreased when other categories increased, or to show that one
category increased at a rate much faster than the other categories.
Slope Chart looks similar to Line Chart, but with certain visual
changes, as slope chart serves the different purpose.

.. figure:: _static/images/slp1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.137: Sample Slope Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Slope Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mandatory data source requirement for a Slope Chart are two
dimensions and one measure. In case the data source does contain
additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data
Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Slope
Chart.

How to use the Slope Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Slope
Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
project.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows one measure – Order Quantity and two Dimensions
   – Calendar Year and Item Category.

3. Add a Slope Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio /SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Slope Chart.

5. The Slope Chart will plot the information from the assigned data
   source (see Figure 4.138).

.. figure:: _static/images/slp2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.138: Slope Chart
Figure 4.138 shows the basic Slope Chart for one measure and two
dimensions. Here you can observe that the measure Order Quantity for the
dimension members Electronics, Music and Movies gets decreased from the
calendar year 2007 to 2009 and at the same time, the measure Order
Quantity for the dimension member Books gets increased from the calendar
year 2007 to 2009.

Advanced Column Bar Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Advanced Column Bar Chart offers an intuitive way to compare any two
measures. In addition to comparing two measures, it also adds a
spotlight to the variance between these measures in terms of absolute
and percentage values. Negative or Positive variance is automatically
categorized as two series. This removes the need to add conditional
formatting to highlight the quality of variance.

.. figure:: _static/images/acb1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.139: Sample Advanced Column Bar Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Advanced Column / Bar Chart 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Advanced Column / Bar Chart
are at least one dimension and two measures to form a minimum of two
Data Series where the Chart can be configured only for two series. In
case the data source does contain additional dimension or additional
measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which
information is to be used by the Advanced Column / Bar Chart.

How to use the Advanced Column / Bar Chart? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Advanced
Column Bar Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Advanced Column / Bar
Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measures Order Cost, Order Amount and Order
   Quantity along a set of members of dimension Item Category.

3. Add a Advanced Column / Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Advanced Column / Bar Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Advanced Column / Bar
   Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the
   sub category Data Series (see Figure 4.140).

.. figure:: _static/images/acb2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.140: Category Data – Series Options
8.  In the area Series Options, you can change the color for the series.
    For our example, set the Series Order Cost to the color Orange.

9.  Set the Series Order Amount to the color Blue.

10. Since the Chart considers only the first two data series in the
    Columns of the Initial View you will be able to set the colors for
    the first two data series Order Cost and Order Amount.

11. By default, the Series Positive and Negative will have Green and Red
    colors. You can also change their colors based on your choice.

12. Now navigate to the area Series Name Change (see Figure 4.141)

.. figure:: _static/images/acb3.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.141: Category Data – Series Name Change
13. Set the Series Order Cost to the name Order Cost.

14. Set the Series Order Amount to the name Order Amount.

15. Set the property ∆PY to the name Var (restricted to 5 characters).

16. Set the property ∆PY% to the name Var% (restricted to 5 characters).

17. Now navigate to the area Shape Options (see Figure 4.142).

.. figure:: _static/images/acb4.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.142: Category Data – Shape Options
18. Set the property Deviation Shape to the option Square. The other
    options are Diamond and Circle.

19. Set the property Deviation Shape Color to the color Black.

20. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the subcategory Chart
    (see Figure 4.143).

.. figure:: _static/images/acb5.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.143: Category Appearance 
21. Set the property Set the Chart Type to the option Column.

22. Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the
    Advanced Column Bar Chart (see Figure 4.144). Here you can observe
    that there are three layers where the bottom layer 1 represents the
    Column Bar Chart for the first two data series Order Cost and Order
    Amount against the dimension Item Category. In this case, you can
    observe that the column bar chart gets displayed based on the
    comparison of the two data series taken as measures. Also, the data
    label gets displayed for the data series having higher value. The
    middle layer 2 shows the vertical column bars representing the
    Variance value for the first two data series Order Cost and Order
    Amount calculated as Series 2 value (Order Amount) – Series 1 value
    (Order Cost). The positive variance value will be denoted in green
    color vertical bars and the negative variance value will be denoted
    in red color vertical bars (see Figure 4.144). The top layer 3 shows
    the thin vertical column bars with deviation shapes at its top. Here
    the Variance % value for the first two data series Order Cost and
    Order Amount is calculated as Series 2 value (Order Amount) – Series
    1 value (Order Cost) /Series 1 value (Order Cost) X 100. The
    positive variance percentage value will be denoted in green color
    vertical bars and the negative variance percentage value will be
    denoted in red color vertical bars (see Figure 4.144).

Pie Charts
----------

Pie Chart Variants Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the charts in the overall VBX suite, you also receive several
variants of a pie chart. Pie charts are best used when making a
part-to-whole comparison with a limited set of members. As part of this
group of Pie Charts you can use the following charts (see Figure 4.150):

-  Pie Chart

-  Donut Chart

-  Semicircle Donut Chart

-  Pie Drilldown Chart

Figure 4.150: Pie Chart Variants
In the following sections we will outline the basic functionality and
the steps to create each of the variants of the Pie Chart.

Pie Chart
~~~~~~~~~

Pie Charts are used to compare a part to the total for the selected
measure.

Figure 4.151: Pie Chart
Figure 4.151 shows a classic Pie Chart, outlining the measure value
along five members of a dimension.

Data Source Requirements for a Pie Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Pie Chart are at least one
dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain
additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data
Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Pie
Chart.

How to use the Pie Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Pie Chart
as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Pie Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows measure Revenue along a set of members of
   dimension Product.

3. Add a Pie Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Pie Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data
   Label.

8. Activate the option Enable Data Labels.

9. In the sub category Data Label set the property Display Format to the
   option Percentage and Value.

Donut Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~

A Donut Chart is very similar to a Pie Chart, with the difference that
the middle is not filled.

Figure 4.153 shows a Donut Chart showing a measure value along several
Region with percentage value data labels.

Data Source Requirements for a Donut Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Donut Chart are at least one
dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain
additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data
Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Donut
Chart.

How to use the Donut Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Donut
Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Donut Chart:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows measure Revenue along a set of members of
    dimension Product.

3.  Add a Donut Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
    Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Assign the data source to the Donut Chart.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
    Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
    Properties.

7.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data
    Label.

8.  Activate the option Enable Data Labels.

9.  In the sub category Data Label set the property Display Format to
    the option Percentage.

10. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and
    to the sub category Chart.

11. In the area General Settings set the option Chart Inner Size to the
    value 100.

Similar to the Pie Chart and the Donut Chart, the Semicircle Donut Chart
is used to represent a slice as part of a total. The difference between
the Semicircle Donut and Pie / Donut Chart is the fact, that the
Semicircle Donut Chart is representing the information either in a
horizontal or vertical half sliced circle (see Figure 4.155).

Data Source Requirements for a Semicircle Donut Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Semicircle Donut Chart are at
least one dimension and one measure. In case the data source does
contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage
the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the
Semicircle Donut Chart.

How to use the Semicircle Donut Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new
Semicircle Donut Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Semicircle Donut Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows measure Revenue along a set of members of
   dimension Product.

3. Add a Semicircle Donut Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Semicircle Donut Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data
   Label.

8. Activate the option Enable Data Labels.

9. In the sub category Data Label set the property Display Format to the
   option Percentage and you will be able to visualize the Semicircle
   Donut Chart (see Figure 4.156).

Pie Drilldown Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Pie Drilldown Chart is an extension of the standard pie chart,
offering the drill down capability as additional feature. The chart
requires at least two dimensions as part of the assigned data source and
displays the first dimension as the initial display and the second (or
more) dimension(s) will be used for the drilldown.

Data Source Requirements for a Pie Drilldown Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Pie Drilldown Chart are at
least two dimensions and one measure. In case the data source does
contain additional dimensions or additional measures, you can leverage
the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used or
leverage the complete data set. The Pie Drilldown Chart can only
visualize a single measure at a time.

How to use the Pie Drilldown Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Pie
Drilldown Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. We will assume that our data set
consists of dimension Product Category, dimension Product, and measure
Revenue.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Semicircle Donut Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project.

3. Add a Semicircle Donut Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Semicircle Donut Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data
   Label.

8. Activate the option Enable Data Labels.

9. In the sub category Data Label set the property Display Format to the
   option Percentage and you will be able to visualize the Pie Drilldown
   Chart (see Figure 4.157).

Figure 4.158 shows the Pie Chart with the next level Drill Down after
you have clicked on a slice in the initial view. In regards to the
number of Drill Down levels, there is no actual limit on the number of
drill downs.

Spie Chart
~~~~~~~~~~

A Spie Chart is an overloaded version of a Pie chart, where you can vary
the height of each segment

along with its width. Unlike Pie, Spie will take two measures, where one
measure represents the slice’s

volume and other represents the slice’s radius.

Data Source Requirements for a Spie Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Spie Chart is at least one
dimension and one measure. In case the data source does contain
additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data
Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Spie
Chart.

How to use the Spie Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Spie

You can follow the steps below to configure the Spie Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows two measures - Order Quantity and Order Cost
   and two dimensions - Item Category and Item Subcategory.

3. Add a Spie Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Spie Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series
   (see Figure 4.160).

whole (as shown in Figure 4.163). The following stacked charts are
included in the VBX suite:

-  Stacked Area Chart

-  Stacked Column Chart

-  Stacked Bar Chart

-  Stacked Percentage Column Chart

-  Stacked Percentage Bar Chart

-  Stacked and Grouped Column Chart

Figure 4.163: Stacked Charts
In the next sections we will provide details for a subset of all
available stacked charts to outline the steps to use these chart types.
We will outline the Stacked Column, Stacked Percentage Column, and the
Stacked and Grouped Column Chart in more details. The Stacked Area and
Stacked Bar charts are very similar to the Stacked Column chart type and
you should be able to follow the steps even when using the Stacked Area
or Stacked Bar chart type.

Stacked Column Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Stacked Column Chart provides you with the option to visualize a
measure along two dimensions, with one dimension being displayed on the
X-Axis and the other dimension being used to stack the values (see
Figure 4.164).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.121.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.164: Stacked Column Chart
Figure 4.164 shows a Stacked Column Chart displaying the measure value
along a dimension for the Calendar Month as well as using dimension
Region to stack the values for each column.

Data Source Requirements for a Stacked Column Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Stacked Column Chart are at
least one dimensions and one measure. In case the data source does
contain additional dimensions or additional measures, you can leverage
the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the
chart or use the complete data set as part of the visualization. A
Stacked Column Chart can stack either the values by a dimension or stack
measure values, which depends on the data source assigned to the chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.122.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.165: Simple Stacked Chart
Figure 4.165 shows a Stacked Column Chart with one dimension and two
measures. In this scenario the dimension is being used for the X-Axis of
the chart and the two measures are being stacked.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.123.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.166: Stacked Chart
Figure 4.166 shows another Stacked Column Chart, in this example we have
one dimension Month in the Rows, one Dimension Product in the Columns,
and a measure Costs in the Columns.

You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a
Stacked Column Chart:

-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data
   Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.

-  Each Dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the
   Data source will be used for the stacking of the chart.

How to use the Stacked Column Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Stacked
Column Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer project. For our example we will assume that we have a
data source with two dimensions – dimension Month and dimension Product
– as well as one measures – Revenue. In the initial View of the data
source we placed the dimension Month into the Rows, dimension Product is
placed into the columns, and measure Revenue is placed into the Columns.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Stacked Column Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows measures Revenue and along dimension Month and
   Product.

3. Add a Stacked Column Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.

8. In the area General Settings set the Select Chart Type to the value
   Stacked Column (see Figure 4.167).

Figure 4.168: Stacked Column Chart
Figure 4.168 shows the result of our example with the values of
dimension Month showing on the X-Axis and the members of dimension
Product are used to stack up the values of the measure.

Stacked Percentage Column Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Stacked Percentage Column Chart is very similar to the previously
outlined Stacked Column Chart, with the difference being that the values
are shown on a percentage scale (see Figure 4.169).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.126.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.169: Stacked Percentage Column Chart
Figure 4.169 shows a Stacked Percentage Column Chart displaying the
measure value along a dimension for the Calendar Month on the X-Axis and
dimension Product as the dimension to stack the measure value.

Data Source Requirements for a Stacked Percentage Column Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Stacked Percentage Column
Chart are at least one dimension and one measure. In case the data
source does contain additional dimensions or additional measures, you
can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be
used by the chart or use the complete data set as part of the
visualization. A Stacked Percentage Column Chart can stack either the
values by a dimension or stack measure values, which depends on the data
source assigned to the chart.

You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a
Stacked Percentage Column Chart:

-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data
   Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.

-  Each Dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the
   Data source will be used for the stacking of the chart.

How to use the Stacked Percentage Column Chart? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Stacked
Column Percentage Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. For our example we will assume that

   Stacked Percentage Column and you will be able to visualize the
   Stacked Percentage Column Chart (see Figure 4.169).

Stacked and Grouped Column Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Stacked and Grouped Column Chart allows you to not only stack values
for a specific dimension but to also group values along a second
dimension, so in total the chart allows you to visualize the information
of three dimensions.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.127.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.170: Stacked and Grouped Column Chart
Figure 4.170 shows a Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart visualizing
dimension Region on the X-Axis and stacking up the values for the
different products – Food, Home Appliances, and Electronics – for two
groups.

Data Source Requirements for a Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Stacked and Grouped Colum
Chart are at least one dimension in the Rows, one dimension in the
Columns, and one measure in the initial view of the data source. In case
the data source does contain additional dimensions or additional
measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which
information is to be used by the chart or use the complete data set as
part of the visualization.

You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a
Stacked and Grouped Column Chart:

-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data
   Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.

-  Each dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the
   Data Source will be used to stack items inside each group.

-  Measures will be used to group items together.

How to use the Stacked and Grouped Colum Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Stacked
and Grouped Colum Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. For our example we will assume that
we have a data source with dimension Month in the Rows, dimension
Product Category in the Columns, and dimension Product Group as second
dimension in the Columns as well as measure Net Value in the Columns.

Figure 4.171 shows dimension Month along the X-Axis, dimensions Item
Category and Item Sub category are being used to stack items inside each
group and measure Order Cost is being used to group items together.

Stream Graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stream Graph is a variation of a Stacked Area Chart, but instead of
plotting values against a fixed, straight axis, a Stream Graph has
values displaced around a varying central baseline. Stream Graph
displays the changes in data over time of different categories with the
help of flowing, organic shapes that somewhat resemble a river-like
stream.

.. figure:: _static/images/stream1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.172: Sample Stream Graph
Data Source Requirements for a Stream Graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Stream Graph is one dimension
and one measure. In case the data source does contain additional
dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool
to specify which information is to be used by the Stream Graph.

How to use the Stream Graph?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Stream
Graph in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Stream Graph:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows four measures – Order Cost, Discount Amount,
   Order Quantity and Order Amount and two Dimensions – Item Category
   and Item Subcategory.

3. Add a Stream Graph from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio /SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Stream Graph.

5. The Stream Graph will plot the information from the assigned data
   source (see Figure 4.173).

.. figure:: _static/images/stream2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.173: Stream Graph
Figure 4.173 shows the basic Stream Graph for four measures and two
dimensions. Here you can observe that the Measure Order Cost for the
Dimension Item Subcategory Computers is 1,585,319 where the value is
shown through the central baseline instead of plotting values against
the axes. You can use now the Additional Properties to customize the
layout and look and feel.

Additional Properties of Stacked Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Properties
outlined in section 4.5, the stacked charts also provide the Additional
Properties for the X-Axis and Y-Axis outlined in section 4.5.5.1.

Scripting in Stacked Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Stacked Charts are listed as
part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section 4.6.

Gauges

In the last section, we have outlined on how you can setup a new
Advanced Gauge as part of your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer project. In the next section, we will outline on how you
can setup a new Linear Gauge as part of your SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

Linear Gauge
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Linear Gauge also allows you to visualize two measure values with a
different look and feel when compared to Advanced Gauge. The Linear
Gauge will be displayed in the form of a single gauge with two pointers
based on the configuration of the additional properties for two measure
values.

Data Source Requirements for a Linear Gauge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for an Linear Gauge is to define a
Data Cell Selection, meaning to assign a single cell value to the Linear
Gauge for each value you would like to display as part of the gauge.

How to use the Linear Gauge?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Linear
Gauge as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Linear Gauge:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows one measure - Sales Amount - and one
    dimension Product.

3.  Add a Linear Gauge from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
    Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Assign the data source to the Linear Gauge.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Linear Gauge.

6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

7.  Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series
    and to the area Data Value in the Additional Properties of the
    Linear Gauge. For our example, set the property Number of Data
    Values to the option Double, so that we can assign two values to the
    gauge (see Figure 4.192).

8.  Now for Data Value 1, enter the name for the property Data Series
    Name which would be displayed along with the selected data value in
    the form of a tool tip for the dial.

9.  The property Data Value Type has two types Static and Dynamic. For
    our example, set the property Data Value type to the option Dynamic.

10. When the property Data Value Type is selected as “dynamic”, you have
    the option to select a single cell for each data value from the
    overall data set. Click the button for the property Dynamic Data
    Value to select the value for Data Value 1.

25. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series in
    the Additional Properties of the Linear Gauge. In the area Trend
    Point, you can also configure the Trend Point option. In addition to
    visualizing the value for Data Value 1 and Data Value 2 you have the
    option to show a third value as an indication of a Trend. Trend
    point is an element that is used to show a target value on the gauge
    (see Figure 4.199).

63. Based on the Comparison Value 100, set the color to Orange for the
    range having percentage value from 20 to 40.

64. Based on the Comparison Value 100, set the color to Green for the
    range having percentage value from 40 to 60.

65. Save the Rule 1 settings for the Conditional Formatting.

66. In our example, since the measure for Data Value 1 points to 59.14,
    the range with Green color having percentage value from 40 to 60
    will be applicable and the dial pointing the value 59.14 will be
    represented in Green color.

67. Similarly, you can configure the different properties from the
    different categories in the additional properties of Linear Gauge.

68. You will be able to view the Linear Gauge based on the configured
    properties (see Figure 4.203).

Funnel Charts
-------------

Funnel charts are used to visualize the progressive reduction of data as
it passes from one phase to another, for example the data of a sales
process with data starting with the sales leads on the top and going
down to the qualified leads and finally to the closed deals.

Funnel Charts Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the VBX suite there are two different funnel charts available
to you:

-  Funnel / Pyramid Chart

-  Funnel / Pyramid Drilldown Chart

While the Funnel / Pyramid chart is the basic chart to represent
progressive stages of data, the Funnel / Pyramid Drilldown chart offers
an extension of the basic functionality by adding the Drill Down
functionality to the chart. Figure 4.204 shows a Funnel and Pyramid
chart example.

Figure 4.204: Funnel / Pyramid Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Funnel / Pyramid Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Funnel / Pyramid Chart is a
data source with a minimum of one dimension and one measure. In case of
the Funnel / Pyramid Drilldown Chart the minimum requirements are to
have at least two dimensions and one measure.

How to use the Funnel / Pyramid Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Funnel
Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Solid Gauge:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows a measure Revenue along dimension Sales Stage.

3. Add a Funnel Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Funnel Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Funnel Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and
   to the sub category Chart.

8. In the area General Settings ensure that the property Select Chart
   Type is set to the value Funnel.

Figure 4.205: Funnel Chart
9. Your Funnel Chart should look similar to Figure 4.205 now.

Additional Properties of Funnel Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Additional Properties of the Funnel charts are shown as part of the
common set of Additional Properties in section 4.5.

Scripting Functions for Funnel Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Funnel Charts are listed as
part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section 4.6.

Progression Components
----------------------

Part of the VBX Chart are also a set of components that can be used to
show the progress of a single value against a given target values.

Progression Components Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a list of progression components that are included as
part of the VBX suite (see Figure 4.206):

-  Progress bar

-  Number counter

-  Circular counter

.. figure:: _static/images/4.161.jpg

Figure 4.206: Progression Components
Data Source Requirements for a Progress Component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for any of the Progress Components
is a data source with a minimum of one data cell. The progress
components will visualize the value of a single cell and therefore you
will have to configure a Data Selection in addition to assigning the
data source to the component.

How to use the Progress Bar?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Progress
Bar, which is one of the Progress Components. The Number Counter and
Circular Counter are working very similar and you should be able to
follow the steps below with those components as well.

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows measure Revenue along dimension Product.

3.  Add a Progress Bar from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
    Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Assign the data source to the Progress Bar.

5.  Navigate to the Standard Properties of the Progress Bar.

6.  In case the Standard Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
    Standard Properties to activate the display of the Standard
    Properties (see Figure 4.176).

7.  Select the property Data Selection.

8.  Use the button on the right hand side to open the Data Selection
    dialog.

9.  In the next dialog you have the option to select a single cell from
    the overall data set.

10. Select a single cell.

11. Click OK to close the dialog.

12. Your Progress Bar should look similar to Figure 4.207.

Additional Properties of Progress Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Properties
outlined in section 4.5, the Progress Components support the following
Additional Properties in the following categories.

Composition & Relationship Charts
---------------------------------

In this section of the VBX Charts we will take a closer look at charts
that represent a composition of a measure or a relationship between
several measures.

In this category we will discuss the following chart types:

-  Waterfall Chart

-  Heat Map

-  Scatter Plot Chart

-  Bubble Chart

-  Marimekko Chart

Waterfall chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Waterfall chart is used to visualize how an initial value is changing
by showing the value increase and value decrease and the final balance
(see Figure 4.208). The VBX Waterfall chart has the ability to add an
intermediate result, which can show the balance at a defined data point.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.163.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.208: Waterfall Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Waterfall Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Waterfall Chart are a data
source with at least one dimension and one measure. The data source
should indicate the positive and negative values. In case the data
source does contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can
leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be
used by the Line Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set
onto the chart.

How to use the Waterfall Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Waterfall
Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data
source with a dimension showing the value type and a measure with the
actual value.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows a single measure along a dimension Value Type.

3. Add a Waterfall Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Waterfall Chart.

5. Your initial chart should look similar to Figure 4.209.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.164.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.209: Waterfall Chart
6. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Waterfall Chart.

7. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

8. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series
   (see Figure 4.210).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.165.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.210: Additional Properties
9.  In the area Chart Settings you can activate the option of an
    Intermediate Summary and you can choose after which value the
    Intermediate Summary will be placed using the property Place
    Intermediate Sum After.

10. You also have the ability to enable a custom sort option and you can
    configure elements from the assigned data source as an Interim or
    Final Balance.

11. For our example we place an Intermediate Summary after the value for
    the Service Revenue.

12. Our Waterfall Chart looks now like shown in Figure 4.211.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.166.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.211: Waterfall Chart
Sorting Options for Waterfall Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series,
you can activate the properties Sort By and Enable Custom Sort to enable
the sorting options for the Waterfall chart.

**Sort By**: Using this property in the area Chart Settings, you can
sort the dimension members on the X-Axis based on a set of options. The
options are Initial View, Dimension Text in Ascending order, Dimension
Text in Descending order, Dimension Key in Ascending order, and
Dimension Key in Descending order. For our example, we have selected the
option Dimension Text in Descending order (see Figure 4.212).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.167.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.212: Sort By option
**Enable Custom Sort**: Using this property in the area Chart Settings,
you can sort the dimension members on the X-Axis by defining a custom
sort order. For our example, we created a custom sort order by swapping
the dimension member Audio Equipment in the place of Cameras (see Figure
4.213).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.168.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.213: Custom Sort
Based on the Custom Sort configuration, the Waterfall Chart will be
shown as in Figure 4.214.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.169.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.214: Custom Sort
Enable Interim / Final Balance from Data Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you wish to have an existing entry from the data source as an
Intermediate Balance/Final Balance, then you can enable the property
Enable Interim/Final Balance from the Data Source in the area Chart
Settings. For our example, we have selected the existing entry as
dimension member “Audio Equipment” and assigned the option as
Intermediate Balance for that dimension member (see Figure 4.215).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.170.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.215: Intermediate Balance Selection
Based on the above configuration, you will be able to visualize the
Waterfall Chart as shown in (see Figure 4.216).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.171.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.216: Intermediate Balance on Dimension Member
Sorting and Hierarchy Drill Down options

The Custom Sorting and Interim/Final Balance options will not function
when the Drill Down options for the Waterfall Chart is enabled.

Hierarchy Drill Down options for Waterfall Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with the release 2.0 of the Visual BI Extensions, you are
provided with the following Hierarchy Drill Down options. You can
configure the details by navigating to the category Data and to the sub
category Drill Down (see Figure 4.217).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.172.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.217: Hierarchy Drill Down
**
Enable Hierarchy Drill Down**: Using this property, you can enable the
Hierarchy Drill Down for the Waterfall chart based on the active
Hierarchy based on the Initial View of the data source.

**Include Root Level Nodes**: Using this property you can include or
exclude the Root Level Nodes of the active hierarchy.

**Max no. of Hierarchy Levels**: Using this property, you can specify
the maximum number of levels from the hierarchy, which will be available
for the Drill Down navigation. By specifying the maximum number of
hierarchy levels you can limit the data volume, which you will be able
to retrieve using the drilldown option.

**Activate Hierarchical Labeling**: Using this property you can activate
a specific labeling which will visualize the hierarchical nature of the
data and keep the labels on the X-Axis grouped together based on the
hierarchical structure. For our example the labels of the both Category
and Sub category items appear on the X-Axis (see Figure 4.218)

.. figure:: _static/images/4.173.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.218: Hierarchical Labeling
**Enable Drill Down**: Using the property Enable Drill Down, you will be
able to enable the Drill Down option for the Waterfall Chart. For our
example, we have assigned the data set having the dimensions Item
Category and Item Subcategory and measure Order Cost. Based on this
configuration you will be able to visualize the Waterfall Chart with
dimension Item Category with its dimension members for the measure Order
Cost (see Figure 4.219). When you double click on any one of the
dimension member of the dimension Item Category - for our example
“Books” - it gets drilled down to the next level showing the Waterfall
Chart with dimension members for the dimension Item Subcategory (see
Figure 4.220).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.174.jpg

Figure 4.219: Waterfall Chart with Dimension Item Category
.. figure:: _static/images/4.175.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.220: Waterfall Chart – Drilled Down to Dimension Item SubcategorySubcategory

**Enable Hierarchy Drill Down**: When the property Hierarchical Drill
Down is enabled, then you need to assign a data source having Hierarchy
data set and visualize the Waterfall Chart based on the Hierarchy Drill
Down configuration. In this scenario you will be able to visualize the
Waterfall Chart representing the parent nodes and when you double click
on any one element of the parent node, it gets drilled down to the next
level showing the Waterfall Chart with the elements of the child node.

Hierarchy Drill Down option

The Hierarchy Drill Down option will only function when the Drill Down
option for the Waterfall Chart is enabled.

Additional Properties of the Waterfall chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to supporting the standard set of Additional Properties
outlined in section 4.5 and the Additional Properties for the X-Axis and
Y-Axis outlined in section 4.5.5.1, the Waterfall supports the following
Additional Properties.

Heat Map Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Heat Map Chart gives you the option to visualize the information
based on two dimensions and one measure (see Figure 4.221). The two
dimensions are being used to set the X-Axis as well as the Y-Axis, and
the measure is being used to indicate – in form of a colored matrix –
the value for the combination of these two dimensions.

Figure 4.221: Heat Map Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Heat Map Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Heat Map Chart are a data
source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one dimension in the
Columns of the Initial View of the data source. In addition the data
source should contain at least one measure. In case the data source does
contain additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage
the Data Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the
Heat Map Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the
chart.

You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a Heat
Map Chart:

-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data
   Source will be used for the X-Axis of the chart.

-  Each Dimension placed into the Columns of the Initial View of the
   Data source will be used for the Y-Axis of the chart.

How to use the Heat Map Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Heat Map
Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data
source with a dimension Month in the Rows, a dimension Product in the
Columns, and a measure Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the
data source.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Heat Map Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Heat Map Chart (see Figure 4.222).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.177.jpg

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Heat Map Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series
   (see Figure 4.223).

Scatter Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scatter Charts are used to visualize the correlation of two measures for
a given set of dimension members. A Scatter Chart is visualizing the two
measures on the X-Axis and Y-Axis and the dimension members are just as
a plotted point against those two measures. Scatter charts have the
ability to show trends, clusters, or pattern in a large set of data.

Figure 4.224 shows a Scatter Chart visualizing the relationship of
measure Revenue and Profit for a list of products.

Data Source Requirements for a Scatter Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Scatter Chart are a data
source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and two measures in the
Columns. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or
additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify
which information is to be used by the Scatter Chart or you can decide
to plot the complete data set onto the chart.

You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a
Scatter Chart:

-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data
   Source will be used for the plotted points of the chart.

-  The first measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the
   Data Source will be used for the X-Axis.

-  The second measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the
   Data Source will be used for the Y-Axis.

How to use the Scatter Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Scatter

Bubble Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bubble Charts – very similar to a Scatter Chart – allow you to visualize
several dimensions in a single chart. A Bubble Chart uses two measures –
one on the X-Axis and one on the Y-Axis as well as a third measure,
which is visualized in form of the bubble size.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.181.jpg

Figure 4.226: Bubble Chart
Figure 4.226 shows a Bubble Chart using measure Revenue on the X-Axis,
measure Product Cost on the Y-Axis, and measure Margin is being used to
define the Bubble size.

Data Source Requirements for a Bubble Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Bubble Chart are a data source
with at least one dimension in the Rows, and three measures in the
Columns. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or
additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify
which information is to be used by the Bubble Chart or you can decide to
plot the complete data set onto the chart.

You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a
Bubble Chart:

-  Each Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the Data
   Source will be used as a Data Series element and you can assign the
   different colors in the Additional Properties.

-  The first measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the
   Data Source will be used for the X-Axis.

-  The second measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the
   Data Source will be used for the Y-Axis.

-  The third measure placed in the Columns of the Initial View of the
   Data Source will be used for the Bubble size.

How to use the Bubble Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Bubble
Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data
source with a dimension Product in the Rows and measures Revenue, Cost,
and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined

Scripting Functions for the Bubble Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Bubble Chart are listed in
section 4.6.

Marimekko Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Marimekko chart is essentially a stacked column chart with a variable
column width. In addition to the varying segment heights of a regular
stacked column chart, a Marimekko chart is indicating an additional
dimension using varying column widths. The variable column width on the
X-Axis is based on the share of each member in relation to the total.

	:align: center
Figure 4.228: Marimekko Chart
Figure 4.228 shows a Marimekko Chart with the Product Group on the
X-Axis showing the percentage values in relation to the total value and
the individual Product is plotted in form of a stacked column chart for
each individual Product Group.

Data Source Requirements for a Marimekko Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Marimekko Chart are a data
source with at least two dimensions in the Rows, and one measure in the
Columns. In case the data source does contain additional dimension or
additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify
which information is to be used by the Marimekko Chart or you can decide
to plot the complete data set onto the chart.

You can use the following set of rules for the data structure for a
Marimekko Chart:

-  The first Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the
   Data Source will be used as Dimension for the X-Axis.

-  The second Dimension placed into the Rows of the Initial View of the
   Data Source will be used as Dimension for the stacking of the values.

How to use the Marimekko Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Marimekko
Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data
source with a dimension Month and a dimension Product in the Rows and
measures Revenue in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Marimekko Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Marimekko Chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.184.jpg

11. The property Enable Total Display allows you to display the Total
    for each data series on the X-Axis as numerical value.

12. The property Display Total in Percentage allows you to display the
    Total for each data series on the X-Axis as percentage value share
    of the total value.

13. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart.

14. Scroll down to the area General Settings (see Figure 4.232).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.187.jpg

Data Source Requirements for a Tree Map Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Tree Map Chart is a data
source with single dimension in the Rows, and two measures in the
Columns.

How to use the Tree Map Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Tree Map
Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project. You can follow the steps below to configure the Tree
Map Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows two measures - Sales Amount and Forecast Amount
   - and one dimension Product.

3. Add a Tree Map Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Tree Map Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Tree Map Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
   the Additional Properties of the Tree Map Chart. In the area General
   Settings you can configure the type of Tree Map Chart using the
   property Select Chart Type. There are five different types and each
   type represents a different option to position and size the data:

-  Slice and Dice

-  Stripes

-  Squarified

-  Strip

-  Horizontal stripes

8. For our example, you can set the property Select Chart Type to the
   option Slice and Dice (see Figure 4.236)

.. figure:: _static/images/4.191.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.236: Tree Map Chart – Category Appearance 
9.  Ensure that the property Enable Redraw is activated, so that the
    chart will be redrawn when the browser window is being resized at
    run time.

10. Set the property Dimension Value Display to the option Text Only.
    This property allows you to choose if the dimension should be
    displayed with the Key, Text, or both values.

11. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of
    the Additional Properties for the Tree Map Chart. In the area Chart
    Settings you can assign the measures from your data source to the
    Size and Color options for the chart. (see Figure 4.237).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.192.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.237: Tree Map Chart – Category Data 
12. Set the property Select Measure for Size to the measure Forecast
    Amount.

13. Set the property Minimum Value Color to light blue.

14. Set the property Select Measure for Color to the measure Sales
    Amount.

15. Set the property Minimum Value Color to dark blue.

16. Set the property Select Type of Color Scheme to the option Min-Max
    Color which configures the type of color scheme that will be used.
    The options for the color schemes are listed below

-  Min-Max Color

-  Series Color

-  Custom Color Pallet

17. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data
    Label in the Additional Properties. The Tree Map Chart can use 2
    dimensions for which the data labels inside the containers will be
    shown. As shown in Figure 4.238, you can configure the appearance of
    the data label for each level individually

.. figure:: _static/images/4.193.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.238: Tree Map Chart – Category Appearance
18. Set the property Font Size to the value 10.

19. Set the property Font Family to the option Default.

20. Set the property Font Color to black.

21. Set the property Font Style to the option Bold.

22. Set the property Horizontal Alignment to the option Left.

23. Set the property Vertical Alignment to the option Middle.

24. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
    (see Figure 4.239).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.194.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.239: Tree Map Chart – Category Appearance
25. In the area Data Series set the property Border Color to black.

26. Set the property Border Width to the value 1.

27. Set the property Border Style to the option Solid.

28. Similarly, you can configure the different properties from the
    different categories in the Additional Properties for the Tree Map
    Chart.

29. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.

30. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

31. You will be able to view the Tree Map Chart based on the configured
    properties (see Figure 4.240).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.195.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.240: Tree Map Chart
32. The Tree Map Chart can use a maximum of 2 dimensions and we can
    configure the Labels in regards to the Style for the two different
    levels (see Figure 4.241).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.196.jpg

Scripting Functions for the Tree Map Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Tree Map Chart are listed as
part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section 4.6.

In the last section, we have outlined on how you can setup a new Tree
Map Chart as part of your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project. In the next section, we will outline on how you can
setup a new Tree Map Drill Down Chart as part of your SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

Tree Map Drill Down Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tree Map Drill Down Chart is a version of the Tree Map Chart that is
able to provide the Drill Down functionality for the Tree Map Chart. The
Tree Map Drill Down Chart provides your users the option to Drill Down
from a member in a higher level dimension or a higher level of a
hierarchy to more detailed information.

.. _data-source-requirements-for-a-tree-map-chart-1:

Data Source Requirements for a Tree Map Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Tree Map Chart is a data
source with two dimensions in the Rows, and two measures in the Columns.

How to use the Tree Map Drill Down Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have two different scenarios for the Tree Map Drill Down Chart and
they are outlined in the sections below.

Scenario 1:

In Scenario 1, we will outline how you can setup a new Tree Map Drill

Scripting Functions for the Tree Map Drill Down Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Tree Map Drill Down Chart are
listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in
section 4.6.

Special Charts
--------------

In this category we will take a look at charts that do not fit into any
of the other categories. In this section we will discuss the following
chart types:

-  Dual Axis Chart

-  Multiple Axis Chart

-  Super Combination Chart

-  Sparkline Charts

-  Sparkline Table Chart

-  Tag Cloud Chart

-  Waffle Chart

-  Risk Matrix Chart

-  Calendar Heat Map Chart

Dual Axis Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Dual Axis Chart provides an additional Y-Axis and allows you to plot
multiple sets of data as part of a single chart. For Example, when
measures like Actual Sales, Budgeted Sales, and Profit in % need to be
plotted on a chart, Actual Sales and Budgeted Sales can be plotted on
the primary axes and the Profit values shown as a percentage can be
plotted on the secondary axes.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.211.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.256: Dual Axis Chart
Figure 4.256 shows the Actuals in form of a Column and the Budget in
form of a Line chart, both combined in a Dual Axis Chart.

.. _order-of-displaying-different-chart-types-1:

Order of Displaying Different Chart Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart in the category Data
and the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the
“Series Order” for displaying the different chart types. By changing the
Series Order of the measure items, the order of display for the charts
and the order of legend for the measure items will be changed based on
the changed Series Order.

For our example, in the additional properties of the Dual Axis Chart the
default Series Order for the measure items is shown in Figure 4.257.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.212.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.257: Default Series Order
Based on the above configuration, you will be able to visualize the Dual
Axis Chart being displayed with the default order of legend items and
the default order of display of the charts for the measure items
Discount Amount and Order Amount (see Figure 4.258).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.213.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.258: Default Series Order
For our example, in the additional properties of the Dual Axis Chart
change the Series Order for the measure items Discount Amount and Order
Amount so that the order of legend items and the order of display of the
charts for those measure items will be changed (see Figure 4.259).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.214.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.259: Changed Series Order
Based on the above configuration, the Dual Axis Chart will be displayed
with the changed order of legend items and the changed order of display
of the charts for the measure items Discount Amount and Order Amount
(see Figure 4.260).

Figure 4.260: Changed Series Order
Option to have one Stacked Chart per Available Axis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart in the category Data
and the sub category Data Series, the Stacked Chart types which are
assigned to the measure items can be now mapped to more than one Y-Axis.

For our example in the area Series Type, the measure Order Cost is
assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Discount Amount is
assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Order Quantity is
assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type and measure Order Amount is
assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type (see Figure 4.261).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.216.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.261: Series Type
In the area Series Y-Axis, the measure Order Cost is assigned to the Y
Axis 2, measure Discount Amount is assigned to the Y Axis 1, measure
Order Quantity is assigned to the Y Axis 2 and measure Order Amount is
assigned to the Y Axis 1 (see Figure 4.262).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.217.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.262: Series Order and Series Y-Axis
Based on the above configured settings on Series Type and Series Y-Axis,
you can visualize the Dual Axis Chart (see Figure 4.263). You can
observe that the measures Discount Amount and Order Amount takes the
plot values of Y-Axis 1 and the measures Order Cost and Order Quantity
takes the plot values of Y-Axis 2.

Adding Trendlines 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart in the category Data
and the sub category Trendline, you have the ability to add the
trendlines to the Dual Axis Chart similar to other Charts.

For our example, activate the option Enable Trendline and assign the
Trend Type as “Linear” and the desired Color for the Measure items Order
Amount and Order Cost (see Figure 4.264).

Data Source Requirements for a Dual Axis Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Dual Axis Chart is a data
source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one or more measures
in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additional
dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool
to specify which information is to be used by the Dual Axis Chart or you
can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart.

How to use the Dual Axis Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Dual Axis
Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data
source with a dimension Product in the Rows and measures Revenue, Cost,
and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data source.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Dual Axis Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Dual Axis Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Dual Axis Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series
   (see Figure 4.266).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.221.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.266: Category Data 
8.  In the area Series Type you can configure the type of visualization
    for each of the Data Series in your chart. The available options
    are: (see Figure 4.266)

    -  Column

    -  Column Stacked

    -  Column Stacked Percent

    -  Line

    -  Spline

    -  Area

    -  Area Stacked

    -  Area Stacked Percent

    -  Area Spline

    -  Area Spline Stacked

    -  Area Spline Stacked Percent

9.  In our example we are setting the following Series Type:

    -  Measure Profit: Column Stacked Percent

    -  Measure Costs: Column Stacked Percent

    -  Measure Net Value: Column

10. In the Series Y-Axis area of the Additional Properties you can
    decide which measure is being plotted onto which axis in the chart
    (see Figure 4.266).

Table 4.40: Scripting Functions

Multiple Axis Chart 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Multiple Axis Chart provides the option to setup a chart with as
many axis as you have measures in the assigned data source, meaning you
could create a chart with an axis for each measure.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.223.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.268: Multiple Axis Chart
Figure 4.268 shows the Actuals in form of a Column, the Pre Budget and
Post Budget measure in form of a Line chart and each measure has been
plotted against their own axis.

.. _order-of-displaying-different-chart-types-2:

Order of Displaying Different Chart Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart in the category
Data and the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the
“Series Order” for displaying the different chart types. By changing the
Series Order of the measure items, the order of display for the charts
and the order of legend for the measure items will be changed based on
the changed Series Order.

For our example, in the additional properties of the Multiple Axis Chart
the default Series Order for the measure items is shown in Figure 4.269.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.224.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.269: Default Series Order
Based on the above configuration, the Multiple Axis Chart will be
displayed with the default order of the legend items and the default
order of display of the charts for the measure items Discount Amount,
Order Amount and Order Quantity (see Figure 4.270).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.225.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.270: Default Series Order
For our example, in the additional properties of the Multiple Axis Chart
change the Series Order for the measure items Discount Amount and Order
Amount so that the order of legend items and the order of display of the
charts for those measure items will be changed (see Figure 4.271).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.226.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.271: Changed Series Order
Based on the above configuration, the Multiple Axis Chart will be
displayed with the changed order of legend items and the order of
display of the charts for the measure items Discount Amount and Order
Amount will be changed (see Figure 4.272).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.227.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.272: Changed Series Order
Option to have one Stacked Chart Type per Available Axis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart in the category
Data and the sub category Data Series, Stacked Chart types which are
assigned to the measure items can be now mapped to more than one Y-Axis.

For our example in the area Series Type, measure Discount Amount is
assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Order Amount is
assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type, measure Order Cost is
assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type and measure Order Quantity is
assigned to the Column Stacked Chart type (see Figure 4.273).

Figure 4.273: Series Type
In the area Series Y-Axis, measure Discount Amount is assigned to the Y
Axis 4, measure Order Amount is assigned to the Y Axis 2, measure Order
Cost is assigned to the Y Axis 3 and measure Order Quantity is assigned
to the Y Axis 1 (see Figure 4.274).

Figure 4.274: Series Y-Axis
Based on the above configured settings on Series Type and Series Y-Axis,
you can visualize the Multiple Axis Chart (see Figure 4.275). You can
observe that the measure Discount Amount takes the plot values of Y-Axis
4, the measure Order Amount takes the plot values of Y-Axis 2, the
measure Order Cost takes the plot values of Y-Axis 3 and the measure
Order Quantity takes the plot values of Y-Axis 1.

Adding Trendlines 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart in the category
Data and the sub category Trendline, you have the ability to add the
trendlines to the Multiple Axis Chart similar to other Charts.

For our example, activate the option Enable Trendline and assign the
Trend Type as “Linear” and the desired Color for the Measure items Order
Amount, Order Cost and Order Quantity (see Figure 4.276).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.231.jpg

Figure 4.276: Enable Trendline
Based on the above configuration, you can visualize the Multiple Axis
Chart with the Trendlines assigned to the Measure Items Order Amount,
Order Cost and Order Quantity (see Figure 4.277).

Data Source Requirements for a Multiple Axis Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Multiple Axis Chart is a data
source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one or more measures
in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additional
dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool
to specify which information is to be used by the Multiple Axis Chart or
you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart.

How to use the Multiple Axis Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Multiple
Axis Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use a
data source with a dimension Calendar Month in the Rows and measures
Revenue, Cost, and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data
source.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Multiple Axis Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Multiple Axis Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Multiple Axis Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series
   (see Figure 4.278).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.233.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.278: Category Data 
8.  In the area Series Type you can configure the type of visualization
    for each of the Data Series in your chart. The available options
    are:

    -  Column

    -  Column Stacked

    -  Column Stacked Percent

    -  Line

    -  Spline

    -  Area

    -  Area Stacked

    -  Area Stacked Percent

    -  Area Spline

    -  Area Spline Stacked

    -  Area Spline Stacked Percent

9.  In our example we are setting the following Series Type:

    -  Measure Profit: Line

    -  Measure Costs: Column

    -  Measure Net Value: Column

10. In the Series Y-Axis area of the Additional Properties you can
    decide which measure is being plotted onto which axis in the chart
    (see Figure 4.278). For our example we will plot each measure on its
    own Axis (see Figure 4.279).

Super Combination chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Super Combination chart (see Figure 4.280) is similar to the
Combination chart with an additional feature of displaying the total
composition of the data as a pie chart. Please note, that the Super
Combination chart provides one axis for the different measures.

Figure 4.280: Super Combination Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Super Combination Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Super Combination Chart is a
data source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one or more
measures in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additional
dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool
to specify which information is to be used by the Super Combination
Chart or you can decide to plot the complete data set onto the chart.

How to use the Super Combination Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Super
Combination Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to
use a data source with a dimension Product in the Rows and measures
Revenue, Cost, and Profit in the Columns of the Initial View of the data
source.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Super Combination Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Super Combination Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Super Combination Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series
   (see Figure 4.281).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.236.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.281: Category Data 
8.  In the area Series Type you can configure the Series Type for each
    of the measure values visualized in the chart.

9.  In addition you have the option to include an Average value by
    enabling the property Enable Data Series Average.

10. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
    (see Figure 4.282).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.237.jpg

11. In the area General Settings scroll down to the area Pie. Here you
    can configure the placement and the size of the Pie Chart.

Additional Properties of the Super Combination Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Properties
for all charts and in section 4.5.5.1 we outlined the Additional
Properties for the X-Axis and the Y-Axis. In this section we will
outline the Additional Properties that are specific to the Super
Combination Chart.

Scripting Functions for the Super Combination Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Super Combination Chart are
listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in
section 4.6.

Sparkline Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Sparkline charts (see Figure 4.283) are a condensed form of a line
chart (or bar chart, or area chart), where the focus is on the variation
of the overall trend. The chart plot area has no axes, data labels,
legends or title/sub-title.

Figure 4.283: Sparkline Chart
The Sparkline Chart component supports the following chart types:

-  Area Chart

-  Line Chart

-  Column Chart

-  Bar Chart

-  Win Loss Chart

-  Bullet Chart

Data Source Requirements for Sparkline Charts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sparkline charts do allow you to leverage dimensions and measures as
part of the rows and columns in the underlying data source but it is
important to understand how sparkline charts will use the dimensions and
measures in the rows and in the columns.

Dimensions that are being placed into the Rows area of the initial view
of your data source will also be used as part of the rows of your
sparkline chart. In a situation where multiple dimensions are being
stacked in the Rows area, then those dimensions will be shown in the
rows of the sparkline chart and you will see a chart for each element of
the rows.

For dimensions or measures placed into the columns, the logic is
slightly different. The first element – also being referred to as the
outer element – being placed into the columns will be used to split the
columns of the sparkline charts and the next element will be plotted in
the chart itself.

To illustrate the logic, let us take a look at a quick example. For our
example we assume that we have a data set containing dimension Country
and dimension Region in the rows and measure Revenue in the column.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.239.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.284: Sparkline Chart-Scenario 1
Figure 4.284 shows how such a data set could be used to visualize the
single measure for those two dimensions in form of a sparkline bar
chart. Expanding on the previous example, we will now add dimension
Calendar Month to the columns, so that we have measure Revenue first and
dimensions Calendar Month as the inner dimension in the columns.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.240.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.285: Sparkline Chart-Scenario 2 
Figure 4.285 shows how a Sparkline chart would show the Revenue broken
down by Calendar Month for the two dimensions in the rows.

How to use the Sparkline Charts?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new set of
Sparkline Chart. For our example we will assume that we are going to use
a data source with a dimension Product in the Rows, dimension Calendar
Month in the Columns, and measures Revenue and Cost in the Columns of
the Initial View of the data source. In the Columns we have the Measures
as outer dimension and dimension Calendar Month as inner dimension.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Sparkline Chart component from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Sparkline Chart component.

5. Based on the data source structure, your Sparkline Chart component
   should look similar to Figure 4.286.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.241.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.286: Sparkline Chart
6. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Sparkline Chart
   Component.

7. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

8. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
   (see Figure 4.287).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.242.jpg
	:align: center

9. In the area General Settings you can configure the Chart Type for the
   Sparkline Chart as well as additional settings regarding the Column
   Width, Row Header, and Column Header of the Sparkline Chart
   component.

Bullet Charts as Sparkline Chart

Please note, that when choosing the option to use Bullet Charts as
Sparkline Charts, several additional properties will become available in
the category Data Series so that you can configure the details for the
Bullet Chart.

Additional Properties of the Sparkline Chart Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Properties
for all charts. In this section we will outline the Additional
Properties that are specific to the Sparkline Chart Component.

Scripting Functions for the Sparkline Chart Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Sparkline Chart are listed as
part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section 4.6.

Sparkline Table Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Sparkline Table enables you to build a Table whose columns can be
dimension members, measure values, or embedded Sparkline charts. All
parts of the Table like Header, Data cells, etc can be customized by a
wide range of properties.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.243.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.288: Sparkline Table Chart
Figure 4.288 shows an example of a Sparkline Table Chart combining
information in form of simple measure columns – such as the column
Income – as well as charts inside the Table, such as the Income per
Quarter.

Data Source Requirements for the Sparkline Table Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum requirements for the data source for a Sparkline Table Chart
is a data source with at least one dimension and one measure. In case
the data source does contain additional dimension or additional
measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which
information is to be used by the Sparkline Table Chart or you can decide
to plot the complete data set onto the chart.

How to use the Sparkline Table Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Sparkline
Table Chart. The Sparkline Table Chart allows you to add columns based
on Dimensions, columns based on Measures, and you can add columns which
will display Sparkline Charts. In the next set of steps we will show the
detailed steps for each of those options. For our example we will assume
that we have a data source with the following elements:

-  Dimension Product Group in the Rows

-  Dimension Product in the Rows

-  Dimension Calendar Month in the Columns

-  Measure Revenue in the Columns

-  Measure Profit in the Columns

-  Measure Cost in the Columns

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Sparkline Table Chart component from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Sparkline Table Chart component.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Sparkline Table Chart
   Component.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Table
   Definition (see Figure 4.289).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.244.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.289: Category Data 
8. The Sparkline Table Chart starts with an empty definition. Click on
   Add Column.

The following steps will outline on how to add Dimension based column:

1. Set the Column Type to the option Dimension (see Figure 4.290).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.245.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.290: Dimension Column
2. You can now enter a Column Header, define the Column Width, and
   select which Dimension you would like to add as column to the
   Sparkline Table.

3. For our example we are using the following values:

   -  Column Header: Product Group

   -  Column Width: 25%

   -  Select Dimension: Product Group

   -  Dimension Display: Text

4. After entering those details click Save to add the new column to the
   Table (see Figure 4.291).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.246.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.291: New Dimension Column
5. Click on Add Column.

The following steps will outline on how to add Measure based column:

1. Set the Column Type to the option Measure (see Figure 4.292).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.247.jpg

Tag Cloud Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Tag Cloud Chart is a visual representation of text data. Tags in the
chart are usually single words and the importance of each tag is
represented by the size and color.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.251.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.296: Tag Cloud Chart
Figure 4.296 shows a sample Tag Cloud Chart for a list of products and
two measures assigned to the size of the text and the color of the text.

Data Source Requirements for a Tag Cloud Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum requirements for the data source for a Tag Cloud Chart is a
data source with at least one dimension and two measures. In case the
data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures,
you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is
to be used by the Tag Cloud Chart.

You can follow these rules in regards to the data structure for a Tag
Cloud Chart:

-  The first dimension in the Rows will be used for the Text value.

-  The first measure in the Columns will be used for the Font Size.

-  The second measure in the Columns will be used for the Font Color.

How to use the Tag Cloud Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Tag Cloud
Chart. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with
the following elements:

-  Dimension Product in the Rows

-  Measure Net Value in the Columns

-  Measure Profit in the Columns

-  Measure Cost in the Columns

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Tag Cloud Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Tag Cloud Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Tag Cloud Chart
   Component.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the display of the Additional
   Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
   (see Figure 4.297).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.252.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.297: Category Appearance
8. In the area General Settings you can configure the following
   properties:

   -  Dimension Value Display: Here you can choose between the Key,
      Text, Key and Text, or Text and Key as display option for the
      dimension members.

   -  Tag Cloud Shape: Here you can choose between an Elliptic or a
      Rectangular layout of the Tag Cloud Chart.

   -  Minimum Color: Here you can select the color for the Minimum value

   -  Maximum Color: Here you can select the color for the Maximum
      value.

9. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility
   (see Figure 4.298).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.253.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.298: Category Data 
10. In the Category Data you can configure the following properties:

    -  Enable Data Utility Tool: In case you would like to specify other
       Dimensions or Measures for the chart, you can enable the Data
       Utility and then specify the elements for the chart.

    -  Select Dimension: Here you can select the dimension that will be
       used for the text value of the chart.

    -  Measure for Font Size: Here you can specify the Measure that will
       be used for the Font Size.

    -  Measure for Font Color: Here you can specify the Measure that
       will be used for the Font Color.

    -  Select Aggregate Function: Here you can set the Aggregate
       Function for the measure values.

11. For our example we will use the following settings:

    -  Enable Data Utility Tool: Activated

    -  Select Dimension: Product

    -  Measure for Font Size: Profit

    -  Measure for Font Color: Costs

    -  Select Aggregate Function: Sum

12. Your Tag Cloud Chart should now look similar to Figure 4.299:

Waffle Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Waffle Chart will be displayed in the form of boxes in a 10 x 10
Matrix where the measure value will be represented in form of a static
number or percentage value. A Waffle chart is often used to visualize
the percentage share or achievement of a specific target value.

Figure 4.300: Waffle Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Waffle Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Waffle Chart is a data source
at least two cell values, so that one cell selection would represent the
value and the second value would represent the maximum value. In
addition, the Waffle Chart can also leverage dimensions in the rows for
the Dimension Stacking feature.

How to use a Waffle Chart 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Waffle
Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Waffle Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows two measure - Sales Amount and Forecast Amount-
   and one dimension Product.

3. Add a Waffle Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Waffle Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Waffle Chart (see Figure
   4.301).

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
   the Additional Properties of the Waffle Chart (see Figure 4.301). In
   the area General Settings you can configure the type of Waffle Data
   using the property Select Chart Type. You have the option to choose
   between Percentage or Number. Percentage will represent the values as
   actual percentages, even when the assigned values are of numeric
   nature. Number will represent the assigned values as numeric values.

For our example, you can set the property Select Chart Type to the
option Percentage (see Figure 4.301).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.256.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.301: Waffle Chart – Category Appearance 
8.  Set the property Value Color to Orange for those boxes representing
    the value.

9.  Ensure that the property Display Empty Boxes is enabled, so that the
    empty boxes will be displayed

10. Set the property Empty Area Color to Grey for those boxes
    representing the empty values.

11. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of
    the Additional Properties for the Waffle Chart (see Figure 4.302).
    In the area Calculation you can configure the Waffle Chart using
    Static Data, Dynamic Data and the option to setup a Calculation for
    two measures. For our example, we will proceed with the option to
    setup a calculation using two different dynamic data values.

12. Ensure that the property Enable Calculation is activated (see Figure
    4.302).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.257.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.302: Waffle Chart – Category Data 
13. Click the button to set the property Select Measure 1 to a single
    cell value selection from the data set.

14. Once clicked, the Select Data dialog opens and you can select the
    value for Measure 1 (see Figure 4.303).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.258.jpg
	:align: center

Figure 4.304: Waffle Chart – Category Data 
16. Click the button to set the property Select Measure 2 to a single
    cell value selection from the data set (see Figure 4.304).

17. Once clicked, the Select Data dialog opens and you can select the
    value for the property Measure 2 (see Figure 4.305).

Figure 4.306: Waffle Chart – Category Data 
19. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.

20. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

21. Now you are able to view the Waffle Chart based on the percentage
    calculated for the dynamic data values for the given two measure
    values (see Figure 4.307).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.262.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.307: Waffle Chart with dynamic data for two measure values
22. You can also configure the Waffle Chart with a feature called
    Dimension Stacking. Dimension Stacking is used to represent the
    percentage share of each member from a selected dimension as part of
    the Waffle Chart.

23. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of
    the Additional Properties for the Waffle Chart.

24. In the area Dimension Stacking activate the property Enable
    Dimension Stacking (see Figure 4.308). To use Dimension Stacking,
    you need to add a Data Source with at least one dimension in the
    Rows.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.263.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.308: Waffle Chart – Category Data 
25. Set the property Select Measure to the option Sales Amount.

26. With Dimension Stacking enabled you will then receive each dimension

Risk Matrix Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Risk Matrix chart gives you the option to visualize your project risks
along two dimension – Probability and Business Impact. In addition, you
can add the visualization of a third measure to visualize the
significance of the risk in form of a bubble. The Risk Matrix can be
configured with different matrix sizes and you will be able to define
the color coding for the different areas of the chart using the colors
green, yellow and red.

Data Source Requirements for a Risk Matrix Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Risk Matrix is a data source
with at least one dimension in the Rows, and two measures in the
Columns. Table 4.58 shows the sample data set for the Risk Matrix.

+--------------------------------+--------+-------------+--------------+
| Risk Description               | Impact | Probability | Significance |

How to use a Risk Matrix Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline, how you can setup a new Risk
Matrix Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Risk Matrix Chart:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows two measures – Probability and Impact -
    and one dimension Risk.

3.  Add a Risk Matrix Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Assign the data source to the Risk Matrix Chart.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Risk Matrix Chart (see
    Figure 4.318).

6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

7.  Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series in
    the Additional Properties of the Risk Matrix Chart (see Figure
    4.318).

8.  In the area Chart Settings you can configure the Risk Matrix Chart
    with X and Y Axis Measures. For our example, set the property Select
    X-Axis Measure to the measure Probability.

9.  Set the property Select Y-Axis Measure to the measure Impact.

10. Activate the property Enable Bubble Size in case you would like to
    represent the Significance of the risk by assigning a measure from
    the data source.

11. When the property Enable Bubble Size is activated, you need to
    assign a measure to the property Size. For our example, the option
    is activated (see Figure 4.318) and the measure Impact is assigned.

12. When the property Display Occurrences is activated, the number of
    risks in each of the matrix categories will be shown as a numeric
    value displayed in each of the squares.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.273.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.318: Category Data 
13. You can configure the axis scale for the X-Axis and Y-Axis to be
    based on a Percentage assignment or an Absolute value assignment.
    When selecting the option “Percentage”, you can assign percentage
    values for the start and end values of each range of the axis. The
    assigned percentages will then calculate the actual start and end
    values for the ranges based on the assigned percentage values and
    the assigned measures.

14. When selecting the option “Absolute”, you have the option to assign
    absolute start and end values for each range on the axis.

15. For our example, set the property X-Axis and Y-Axis Range Type to
    the option “Absolute” (see Figure 4.319 and see Figure 4.320)

16. Based on the absolute values of the measure Probability and the
    measure Impact, the Risk Matrix is configured.

17. You can change the text for the labels based on your choice. For our
    example, set the property Range 1 to the value from 0 to 1 (see
    Figure 4.319 and see Figure 4.320).

18. Set the property Range 2 to the value from 1 to 2.

19. Set the property Range 3 to the value from 2 to 3.

20. Set the property Range 4 to the value from 3 to 4.

21. Set the property Range 5 to the value from 4 to 5.

Figure 4.320: Category Data 
22. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data
    Label. Ensure that the property Enable Data Labels is activated (see
    Figure 4.321).

23. For our example, set the property Data Label Type to the option
    Dimension.

24. You can also set the property Data Label Measure and the three
    different options for the Measure are

-  X-Axis

-  Y-Axis

-  Z-Axis (Size)

.. figure:: _static/images/4.276.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.321: Category Appearance 
25. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
    (see Figure 4.322). In the area Matrix Color you can configure the
    size of the Risk Matrix chart. For our example, you can set the
    property Select Matrix Size to the option 5x5.

26. After you configured the size of the Risk Matrix, you need to
    configure the Color Range. Based on the configured size of the Risk
    Matrix – in our example 5x5 – you will have to configure color codes
    for values from 1 to 25.

27. For our example, Table 4.59 shows the Color code and Range value for
    5x5 Matrix (see Figure 4.322)

+--------+-------------+
| Color  | Range Value |
+========+=============+
| Green  | 0 - 10      |
+--------+-------------+
| Yellow | 11 - 20     |
+--------+-------------+
| Red    | 21 - 30     |
+--------+-------------+

Calendar Heat Map Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Calendar Heat Map Chart allows you to display the distribution of a
measure across a date / time based calendar heat map. The Calendar Heat
map can display up to two time dimensions.

Data Source Requirements for a Calendar Heat Map Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum data source requirement for a Calendar Heat Map Chart is a
data source with at least one dimension in the Rows, and one measure in
the Columns. The dimension will have to be a date / time representation,
such as a calendar day, calendar month, week, year, etc.

How to use a Calendar Heat Map Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Calendar
Heat Map as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Calendar Heat Map Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows three measures – Number of Records, Key Figure
   1 and Key Figure 2 - and three dimensions Calendar Year, Calendar
   Month, and Timeseries Time.

3. Add a Calendar Heat Map Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Calendar Heat Map Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Calendar Heat Map Chart
   (see Figure 4.327).

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series in
   the Additional Properties of the Calendar Heat Map Chart (see Figure
   4.327).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.282.jpg

Figure 4.327: Category Data
8. For our example, in the area Chart Settings set the property Domain
   to the option Year. The other options are listed below

-  Month

-  Week

-  Day

-  Hour

The Domain of the Calendar Heat Map is the most outer time dimension and
the Sub Domain is the inner dimension of the Calendar Heat Map.

9.  Set the property Domain Range to the value 3 to display three domain
    values – in our example three years.

10. Set the property Sub Domain to the option Month.

11. Set the property Minimum and Maximum Date to the option Dynamic. By
    setting it to Dynamic, the maximum and minimum dates will be derived
    from the assigned data source.

12. Set the property Week Start to the option Monday.

13. Using the property Return Format you can specify the format for the
    return format as part of the scripting functions.

14. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
    and to the area General Settings (see Figure 4.328).

15. Set the property Chart Orientation to the option Horizontal.

16. Ensure that the property Enable Previous/Next Navigation is
    activated so that you will be able to navigate to the Calendar Heat
    Map.

17. Set the property Number of Previous/Next Steps to the value 1, so
    that each navigation step will move the Calendar Heat Map by one
    year.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.283.jpg

Figure 4.328: Category Appearance
18. Set the property Row Limit to the value 3, so that three rows of the
    Domain value – in our case year – will be shown (see Figure 4.328).

19. Set the property Column Limit to the value 3 which shows three
    columns in a domain.

20. Set the property Cell Size to the value 15.

21. Set the property Cell Padding to the value 2 which adjusts the space
    between each cell in the domain.

22. Set the property Cell Radius to the value 1.

23. Set the property Domain Gutter to the value 10 which adjusts the
    space between each domain.

24. Set the property Domain Margin to the value 15.

25. Set the property Reading Order to the option Top to Bottom. The
    Reading Order is defining how the data is going to be displayed. For
    example, a Reading Order Top to Bottom will display the days of a
    month first from top to bottom and then the next set of days in the
    next column for the month.

26. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series in
    the Additional Properties of the Calendar Heat Map Chart (see Figure
    4.329).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.284.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.329: Category Data Series
27. In the area Chart Settings, you can then select the dimensions that
    are available for the Calendar Heat Map and you can assign the
    format for each of the dimensions using the placeholders.

28. You can choose the measure from the property Select Measure that
    will be used to visualize the information. In our example, measure
    Number of Records.

29. Set the property Year to the format YYYY.

30. Set the property Month to the format MM.

31. Click Save to save the properties.

32. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
    the Additional Properties (see Figure 4.330). In the area Color
    Scheme you can configure the Color Scheme for the Calendar Heat Map
    Chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.285.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.330: Category Appearance
33. For our example, set the property Select Color Scheme to the option
    Custom.

34. Set the property No. of Color Buckets to the value 5 which shows 5
    buckets below the domains.

35. Set the property Choose Nature of data to the option Sequential.

36. Set the property Choose Color Scheme for the cell color based on
    your choice.

37. You will be able to view the Calendar Heat Map Chart based on the
    configured properties (see Figure 4.331).

Performance Charts
------------------

Other useful charts that do not fall under the categories mentioned
previously, are grouped into the Performance Charts category. The
performance charts allow several different measures to be compared
against the benchmark in the same chart. In this category you will find
the details of the following chart types:

-  Bullet Chart

-  Fixed Column Chart

-  Box Plot Chart

Bullet Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bullet chart (see Figure 4.332) is an enhanced bar/column chart
where the performance measure is plotted against a comparison measure,
which is highlighted as a marker over the performance measure. The
background of the chart is also filled with a color code, which shows
the qualitative range for the performance measure.

Deviation Display in Bullet Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the Bullet Chart in the category Data
and the sub category Data Series, you have the option to define the
Deviation Display Bar for the Bullet Chart to view the difference value
between the Performance Measure and the Comparison Measure.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the
Deviation Display Bar in the Bullet Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source has a dimension Item Category and three measures –
   Order Quantity, Order Cost and Order Amount.

3. Add a Bullet Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio / SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Bullet Chart.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Bullet Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the
   sub category Data Series (see Figure 4.333).

.. figure:: _static/images/bul1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.333: Category Data –  Chart Settings
8.  In the area Chart Settings, set the property Performance Measure to
    the option Order Amount.

9.  Set the property Comparison Measure 1 to the option Order Quantity.

10. Set the property Comparison Measure 2 to the option Order Cost.

11. Navigate to the area Deviation Display (see Figure 4.334).

.. figure:: _static/images/bul2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.334: Category Data – Dimension Display
12. Activate the property Enable Deviation Display.

13. Set the property Comparison Value to the option Comparison Measure
    2.

14. Set the property Positive Deviation Description to the option Good.

15. Now navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category
    Chart (see Figure 4.335).

.. figure:: _static/images/bul3.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.335: Category Appearance – Deviation Display
16. Set the property Show Deviation For to the option Both. The other
    options are Positive and Negative.

17. Set the property Positive Color to the color Green.

18. Set the property Negative Color to the color Red.

19. Set the Point Range to the value 0.2 which defines the width of the
    Deviation Bar.

20. Activate the property Enable Data Label.

21. Activate the property Numeric Display which displays the difference
    value between the Performance Measure and the Comparison Measure.

22. Based on the above configured settings, the Bullet Chart will be
    displayed with the Deviation Bar representing the difference value
    between the Performance Measure and the Comparison Measure for the
    assigned data set (see Figure 4.336) and the Green color represents
    the Positive Deviation value based on the configuration.

Data Source Requirements for a Bullet Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum requirements for the data source for a Bullet Chart is a
data source with at least one dimension and two measures. In case the
data source does contain additional dimension or additional measures,
you can leverage the Data Utility tool to specify which information is
to be used by the Bullet Chart.

You can follow these rules in regards to the data structure for a Bullet
Chart:

-  Dimensions in the Rows will be used to generate a Bullet Chart per
   element in the Rows.

-  You will need at least two measures for the Performance Measure as
   well as for at least one Qualitative Range measure.

-  All three Qualitative Ranges can be based on measure values or you
   can base them on a percentage value calculation based on a single
   measure value.

How to use the Bullet Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Bullet
Chart. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with
the following elements:

-  Dimension Product in the Rows

-  Measure Net Value in the Columns

-  Measure Profit in the Columns

-  Measure Cost in the Columns

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Bullet Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Bullet Chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.297.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.337: Bullet Chart
5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Bullet Chart.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, use the menu View •
   Additional Properties to activate the Additional Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Appearance and
   to the sub category Chart (see Figure 4.338).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.298.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.338: Category Appearance
8. In the area General Settings you can configure if you would like to
   see a Horizontal or a Vertical oriented Bullet Chart.

9. Now navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series
   (see Figure 4.339).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.299.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.339: Category Data 
10. In the area General Settings you can configure the following
    properties:

    -  Performance Measure: Here you can assign the measure that will be
       used as Performance Measure.

    -  Comparison Measure 1: Here you can assign the measure that will
       be used as first comparison value.

    -  Comparison Measure 2: Here you can assign the measure that will
       be used as second comparison value.

    -  Qualitative Range Measure 1: Here you can assign the measure that
       will be used end value for the first Qualitative Range.

    -  Qualitative Range Measure 2: Here you can assign the measure that
       will be used end value for the second Qualitative Range.

    -  Qualitative Range Measure 3: Here you can assign the measure that
       will be used end value for the third Qualitative Range.

    -  Percentage Qualitative Range 1: This option allows to enter a
       percentage value for the calculation of the Qualitative Range 1
       based on a single measure.

    -  Percentage Qualitative Range 3: This option allows to enter a
       percentage value for the calculation of the Qualitative Range 3
       based on a single measure.

11. You have three options to define the Qualitative Ranges for the
    Bullet Chart:

    -  Option 1: You use the three settings and assign three individual
       measures to each of the Qualitative Ranges. This option allows to
       leverage measures from the data source and therefore the ranges
       stay dynamic.

    -  Option 2: You use the individual sliders in the Qualitative
       Ranges area of the category Data (see Figure 4.340). This option
       allows you to define Qualitative Ranges for each dimension
       member.

    -  Option 3: You assign one measure to the Qualitative Ranges and
       use percentage values for the other two Qualitative Ranges.

Example for Option 3:

If "Measure 1" is specified for the Qualitative Range 2, and 40 % is
being entered as value for the Percentage Qualitative Range 1 and 70 %
is being entered as value for the for Percentage Qualitative Range 3,
then the Qualitative Ranges 1 and 3 will be calculated based on the
value of “Measure 1” and the assigned percentage values.

Fixed Column Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Fixed Column Chart (see Figure 4.341) allows you to place measure
values on top of each other – similar to a Bullet Chart shows a
Performance Measure and the Qualitative Ranges in the background.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.301.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.341: Fixed Column Placement Chart
Figure 4.341 shows a Fixed Column Chart visualizing four measures for
three categories and two measures are always placed together.

Data Source Requirements for a Fixed Column Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum requirements for the data source for a Fixed Column Chart is
a data source with at least one dimension in the Rows and two measures
in the Columns. In case the data source does contain additional
dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data Utility tool
to specify which information is to be used by the Fixed Column Chart.

You can follow these rules in regards to the data structure for a Fixed
Column Chart:

-  The first measure in the Columns will be placed into the background
   and will be visualized by the wider bar / column.

-  The second measure in the Columns will be placed into the front of
   the first measure and will be visualized by the thinner bar / column
   inside of the bar / column of the first measure.

How to use the Fixed Column Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Fixed
Column Chart. For our example we will assume that we have a data source
with the following elements:

-  Dimension Product in the Rows

-  Measure Net Value in the Columns

-  Measure Profit in the Columns

-  Measure Cost in the Columns

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Fixed Column Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the chart.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.302.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.342: Fixed Column Chart
5. The chart will use the first measure in the column and display it as
   the column in the back – in our example Net Value – and the second
   measure will be placed inside – in our example Profit (see Figure
   4.342).

Additional Properties of the Fixed Column Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Properties
for all charts and in section 4.5.5.1 we outlined the Additional
Properties for the X-Axis and the Y-Axis. In this section we will
outline the Additional Properties that are specific to the Fixed Column
Chart.

Scripting Functions for the Fixed Column Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Fixed Column Chart are listed
as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section
4.6.

Box Plot Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A box plot chart is a standardized and convenient way of displaying the
distribution of data based on their quartiles: minimum, first quartile,
median, third quartile, and maximum (see Figure 4.343).

Figure 4.343: Box Plot Chart Metrics
Data Source Requirements for a Box Plot Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Box Plot Chart has two main options to leverage the information from
the assigned data source.

-  You can decide to assign the data source and let the chart calculate
   the different values - such as the lower quartile, median, and upper
   quartile – based on all measures in the assigned data source.

-  You can assign individual measures from the data source to each of
   the needed values for a Box Plot chart.

-  

Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series of the
Additional Properties for the Box Plot Chart. In the area Chart Settings
you can find the area Assign Measures manually (see Figure 4.344).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.304.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.344: Category Data 
Figure 4.344 shows the option to calculate the values as part of the
chart by activating the option Calculate Values based on Data Source, or
to assign measures from the data source to each of the necessary values
for the Box Plot Chart.

How to use the Box Plot Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Box Plot
Chart. For our example we will assume that we have a data source with
the following elements:

-  Dimension with six members in the Rows

-  24 Measures representing measurement values per dimension member

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project similar to the description outlined
   previously.

3. Add a Box Plot Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the chart (see Figure 4.345).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.305.jpg

Sankey Chart
------------

Sankey Chart – Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sankey Chart is a visualization used to depict a flow from one set of
values to another. The things being connected are called nodes otherwise
named as “dimensions” and the connections are called links otherwise
named as “measures”.  Sankey charts are typically used to visualize
energy or material or cost transfers between processes.

.. figure:: _static/images/sk1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.348: Sample Sankey Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Sankey Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mandatory data source requirement for a Sankey Chart are two
dimensions and one measure. In case the data source does contain
additional dimension or additional measures, you can leverage the Data
Utility tool to specify which information is to be used by the Sankey
Chart.

How to use the Sankey Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Sankey
Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
project. For these steps we assume we have a data source, similar to the
Table shown below.

+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| From Warehouse | To Warehouse | Materials Count |
+================+==============+=================+
| Warehouse A    | Warehouse B  | 500             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse A    | Warehouse C  | 250             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse B    | Warehouse C  | 700             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse B    | Warehouse D  | 350             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse C    | Warehouse E  | 315             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
| Warehouse C    | Warehouse F  | 320             |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------+

Table 4.78: Sample Data

You can follow the steps below to configure the Sankey Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows one measure – Materials Count and two
   Dimensions – From Warehouse and To Warehouse.

3. Add a Sankey Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio /SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Sankey Chart.

5. The Sankey Chart will plot the information from the assigned data
   source (see Figure 4.349).

.. figure:: _static/images/sk2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.349: Sankey Chart
Figure 4.349 shows the basic Sankey Chart for one measure and two
dimensions. Here you can observe that the nodes represent the dimensions
- From Warehouse and To Warehouse and the links represent the measure -
Materials Count. You can use now the Additional Properties to customize
the layout and look and feel.

Additional Properties of Sankey Chart 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Additional Properties of the Sankey Chart are shown as part of the
common set of Additional Properties in section 4.5.

Scripting Functions for Sankey Chart 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Sankey Chart are listed as
part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section 4.6.

Parallel Coordinates Chart
--------------------------

Parallel Coordinates Chart – Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parallel Coordinates Chart is used to visualize and compare a set of
data points that are defined in multiple dimensions and measures where
each dimension and measure has its own axis.

.. figure:: _static/images/parallelc1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.350: Sample Parallel Coordinates Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Parallel Coordinates Chart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The possible combination of measures and dimensions as part of data
source requirement for a Parallel Coordinates Chart is listed below:

+----------+------------+
| Measures | Dimensions |
+==========+============+
| Single   | Single     |
+----------+------------+
| Multiple | --         |
+----------+------------+
| --       | Multiple   |
+----------+------------+
| Multiple | Multiple   |
+----------+------------+

Table 4.79: Combination of Measures and Dimensions

In case the data source does contain multiple dimension or additional
measures, you can leverage them by navigating to the category Data and
to the sub category Data Series in the Additional Properties to specify
which information is to be used by the Parallel Coordinates Chart.

How to use the Parallel Coordinates Chart?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Parallel
Coordinates Chart in your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer project.

You can follow the steps below to configure the Parallel Coordinates
Chart:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows three measures – Order Quantity, Order Amount
   and Discount Amount, and two Dimensions – Item Category and Item
   Subcategory.

3. Add a Parallel Coordinates Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio /SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Parallel Coordinates Chart.

5. The Parallel Coordinates Chart will plot the information from the
   assigned data source (see Figure 4.351).

.. figure:: _static/images/parallelc2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.351: Parallel Coordinates Chart
Figure 4.351 shows the basic Parallel Coordinates Chart for three
measures and two dimensions. Here you can observe that all the assigned
Measures and Dimensions are visualized as separate axis where you can
identify each measure value for the respective dimension by simply
hovering over the series line (see Figure 4.351). You can use now the
Additional Properties to customize the layout and look and feel.

Additional Properties of Parallel Coordinates Chart 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Properties
for all charts and in section 4.5.5.1 we outlined the Additional
Properties for the X-Axis and the Y-Axis. In this section we will
outline the Additional Properties that are specific to the Parallel
Coordinates Chart.

Scripting Functions for Parallel Coordinates Chart 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Parallel Coordinates Chart are
listed as part of the common scripting functions for charts listed in
section 4.6.

Chart Selector and Chart Container 
-----------------------------------

The Chart Selector is a run time component where you will be able to
select a chart from a defined list of available VBX Charts (see Figure
4.352) and update a Chart Container based on the selection. The Chart
Selector is working in combination with the Chart Container component.
By using the Chart Selector and Chart Container component, you can
switch between different chart types without having to write any
scripting code.

The available chart families are:

-  Bar / Column Charts

-  Line Charts

-  Pie Charts

-  Combination Charts

-  Scatter Charts

-  Other Charts

.. figure:: _static/images/4.308.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.352: Chart Selector
The following steps outline, how you can use the Chart Selector and
Chart Container together:

1. Create a new application in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
   Lumira Designer.

2. Add a Chart Selector component from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

3. Add a Chart Container component from the VBX Charts to the dashboard.

4. Now navigate to the category General and to the sub category Chart
   Selector in the Additional Properties of the Chart Selector (see
   Figure 4.353).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.309.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.353: Additional Properties
5. In the Additional Properties of the Chart Selector you can configure
   the following options:

-  **Available Containers**: Here you can select a Chart Container from
   all the available Chart Container components used in your dashboard.
   In case the list is shown empty, you can use the Refresh option to
   update the list

-  **Default Chart Type**: Here you can set the default chart that will
   be selected when the dashboard is executed.

-  **On Select:** By navigating to the category Scripting you can enable
   the interaction with the component by writing script. The On Select
   event is triggered when you select a value in the component.

-  **Chart Configuration**: Here you can select which charts should be
   available as part of the Chart Selector. You can remove charts with a
   simple drag and drop navigation by adding charts to the Dropped
   Charts list on the right hand side. You also have the option to
   either select or unselect a complete chart family by enabling or
   disabling the check-box in the header for each chart family.

6. Now navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart
   in the Additional Properties of the Chart Container (see Figure
   4.354).

.. figure:: _static/images/4.310.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 4.354: Category – Appearance 
7. In the area General Settings you can activate the option Control by
   Chart Selector. When this property is activated, the Chart type will
   change based on the Chart Selector component, otherwise the Chart
   type can be changed using scripting code (see Figure 4.354).

8. When executing your dashboard you will receive a Chart Selector and a
   Chart Container allowing you to quickly switch between the different
   chart types, without the need to setup any scripting code (see Figure
   4.355).

Visual BI Extensions for SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer (VBX) – Selectors
================================================================================================

Selectors Overview
------------------

As part of the overall Visual BI Extensions (VBX) suite, you also
receive a set of selector components, which provide you with abilities
such as being able to select a time period or being able to select a
hierarchy node for filtering.

.. figure:: _static/images/VBX%20Selectors%20New%20Menu.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.1: VBX Selectors
The VBX Selectors (see Figure 5.1) include:

-  | Grid Box
   | The Grid Box provides you with the option to create a set of rows
     and columns acting as a filter for a specified dimension. In
     addition, you are able to configure dynamic alerts allowing you to
     focus on the critical information.

-  | Period Selector YM
   | The Period Selector YM provides you the ability to select a
     calendar year and a calendar month.

-  | Period Selector YQM
   | The Period Selector YQM provides you the ability to select a
     calendar year, a calendar quarter, and a calendar month.

-  | Period Selector YQM MultiSelect
   | The Period Selector YQM MultiSelect, like the Period Selector YQM,
     provides you the ability to select a calendar year, a calendar
     quarter, and a calendar month, but in addition you can select
     multiple values for filtering.

-  | Hierarchical Filter
   | The Hierarchical Filter is a selector component that allows you to
     display a hierarchy based on the assigned data source and to use
     the component for filtering purposes. The component does come also
     with extensive scripting options.

-  | Combo Box
   | The Combo Box allows you to setup a list of dimension members as a
     filter. The list will be displayed in single line drop down box and
     does provide features such as a search functionality as well as the
     option to switch between the different display options, such as the
     key, text, or key and text for the dimension members. In addition
     the Combo Box provides alerting capabilities that allow you to
     setup highlighting for the list of members.

-  | List Box
   | The List Box allows you to setup a list of dimension members as a
     filter. The list will be displayed in form of a box whereas the
     size depends on the configured size at design time. The List Box
     does provide features such as a search functionality as well as the
     option to switch between the different display options, such as the
     key, text, or key and text for the dimension members. In addition
     the List Box provides alerting capabilities that allow you to setup
     highlighting for the list of members.

   | The Facet Filter component allows you to setup multiple facets for
     a single data source. For each facet you can choose from different
     visualization options, such as checkboxes, radio buttons, or a list
     style. All defined facets of the Facet Filter automatically work in
     a cascading filter fashion and you have the option to assign target
     data sources for filtering.

-  | Range Slider
   | The Range Slider provides you with the option to add a typical
     slider component to your dashboard. The Range Slider can be
     configured to present static data, time based information such as
     weeks, months, quarters, or years, and the Range Slider can be
     bound directly to data from the data source. In addition the Range
     Slider provides the ability to setup a conditional formatting to
     highlight specific parts of the Range Slider– for example the scale
     background – based on specific threshold values.

-  Period Selector DWM

   The Period Selector DWM provides you with the ability to add a
   selector to your dashboard which will allow you to select a value for
   the day, a week, a month and a value for the year with one simple
   control.

-  Time Slicer

Data Source Requirements for the Grid Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Grid Box is capable of using static data that is entered manually or
using data from an assigned data source. In the following sections we
will outline the requirements for these two options.

Static Data Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Grid Box the dashboard designer can
activate the property Enable Static Data and enter static data by
navigating to the category General and to the sub category Filter
Settings (see Figure 5.3). The dashboard designer can enter manually the
items that should be displayed as part of the Grid Box. The manually
entered measure values can also be used for setting up static alerts.

Data Source Details for the Grid Box
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case you are planning to use an actual data source for the Grid Box,
you need to understand how the Grid Box is using the data. In this
example we will assume that our data set looks like shown below.

+---------------+-----------------------+-----------+-----------+
| Dimension Key | Dimension Description | Measure 1 | Measure 2 |
+===============+=======================+===========+===========+
| 100           | AAA                   | 10        | 100       |
+---------------+-----------------------+-----------+-----------+
| 200           | BBB                   | 20        | 200       |
+---------------+-----------------------+-----------+-----------+
| 300           | CCC                   | 30        | 300       |
+---------------+-----------------------+-----------+-----------+
| 400           | DDD                   | 40        | 400       |
+---------------+-----------------------+-----------+-----------+
| 500           | EEE                   | 50        | 500       |
+---------------+-----------------------+-----------+-----------+

Table 5.4: Sample Data

In case you would assign such a data source to the Grid Box, the Grid
Box will use the Dimension Key as the key value, the Dimension
Description as Text Value, and Measure 1 as value.

In case you are using a data source with several dimensions in the rows,
as shown below, then the Grid Box will repeat the key and description of
the most outer dimension for each row.

+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Dimension | Dimension | Dimension | Dimension | Measure 1 | Measure 2 |
| 1 Key     | 1         | 2 Key     | 2         |           |           |
|           | Descripti |           | Descripti |           |           |
|           | on        |           | on        |           |           |
+===========+===========+===========+===========+===========+===========+
| 100       | AAA       | 2000      | K2000     | 10        | 100       |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| 100       | AAA       | 2001      | K2001     | 20        | 200       |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| 100       | AAA       | 2002      | K2002     | 30        | 300       |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| 100       | AAA       | 2003      | K2003     | 40        | 400       |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| 100       | AAA       | 2004      | K2004     | 50        | 500       |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| 100       | AAA       | 2005      | K2005     | 60        | 600       |

+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

Table 5.5: Sample Data

In the given example as shown in Table 5.5 above, the Grid Box would
repeat the key and description of the most outer dimensions, in this
example Dimension 1.

Alerting
~~~~~~~~

The dashboard designer has the option to setup two types of alerting for
the Grid Box – Static Alerts and Dynamic Alerts. The dashboard designer
can define a set of static rules (see Figure 5.4) or a set of dynamic
rules based on measure values or calculations.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.004.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.4: Alert Ranges
As part of the dynamic alerting there are three types of rules available
– Single Measure, Measure Calculation, and Target Value. When the Rule
Type is set to the option ‘Single Measure’, you can define a rule based
on a selected measure from the underlying data source with operators
such as “Greater Than”, or “Equal To” (see Figure 5.5). When the Rule
Type is set to the option “Measure Calculation”, you can define a
calculation based on two measures and base the rule on the calculation.
When the Rule Type is set to the option “Target Value”, you can define a
rule based on the selection of Highlighted Measure and Comparison
Measure using the Target Value Type as “Static” or “Dynamic” values.

Figure 5.5: Dynamic Alerts
Based on the rules defined in Figure 5.5, the Grid Box shown in Figure
5.6 displays the configured alerts with the selected icon.

Period Selector YM
------------------

The Period Selector YM (see Figure 5.10) provides you with the ability
to add a selector to your dashboard, which will allow you to choose a
value for the year and a value for the month with one simple control.

Figure 5.10: Period Selector YM
Features of the Period Selector YM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following sections we will describe the most important features
of the Period Selector YM.

Calendar Limits 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YM in the category
General and the sub category Filter Settings, you have the option to
define the Calendar Limits based on the Current Year and a defined
offset for the start and end year.

For our example, enable the option Enable Offset and set the property
“Start Year Offset” to the value -3 and set the property “End Year
Offset” to the value 3 based on the Current Year 2017 (see Figure 5.11).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.011.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.11: Enable Offset
Based on the above configuration you will be able to view the Period
Selector YM as shown in the Figure 5.12. Our example shows the years
from 2014 to 2020, based on the current year being 2017.

Figure 5.12: Start and End Year Offset 
Layout Properties for Month Display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YM in the category
Appearance and the sub category Filter, you will be able to set the
layout to the option “Left to Right” as shown in Figure 5.13. By
default, the months in the Period Selector will be displayed from Top to
Bottom order. When the layout is changed to the option “Left to Right”,
then the months in the Period Selector will be displayed from Left to
Right order.

Maximize and Minimize options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YM in the category
Appearance and the sub category Filter, you have the ability to enable
the option Enable Minimize Maximize. This option will allow the user to
minimize and restore the Period Selector, like a standard window as part
of the Windows operating system (see Figure 5.15).

Figure 5.17: Minimized Period Selector
Return Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YM the dashboard
designer has the option to specify the Return Format of the selected
value. The specified Return Format can then be used as part of the
scripting for the Period Selector and the dashboard designer can use the
returned value in the specified format and use the value as a filter
value for a data source.

The Period Selector YM allows the dashboard designer to specify a date
format from the list of 6 standard return formats such as YYYYMM,
MM.YYYY, YYYYMMM (see Figure 5.18). The dashboard designer can also
define a custom format using the option “Custom Format”.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.018.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.18: Return Formats – Period Selector YM
The option “Custom Format” allows you to use the following format
options to specify a custom format for the return value:

+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Format | Description                                      |
+========+==================================================+
| m      | Displays the month values as 1 – 12.             |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| mm     | Displays the month values as 01 – 12.            |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| mmm    | Displays the month values as Jan – Dec.          |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| mmmm   | Displays the month values as January – December. |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| yy     | Displays the year value as 00 – 99.              |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| yyyy   | Displays the year value as ‘1900 – 9999’         |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+

Table 5.12: Custom Formats – Period Selector YM

For Example, a combination of month and year separated by symbols (like
‘-‘, ‘/’, etc.) could be specified as ‘mmm/yyyy’ and such a custom
format would display the value as May/2015.

The Custom Format will be used as the format for the scripting function
.DSXGetSelectedValueInDateFormat().

Fiscal Year definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the Period Selector component displays the standard calendar
month values from January to December and follows the calendar year. In
case you would like to offset the calendar year to a fiscal year, you
can activate the Fiscal Year option in the Additional Properties (see
Figure 5.19). With the Fiscal Year option you can configure the Starting
Month and the Fiscal Year Label. For example, if April 2015 is the start
of your Fiscal Year 2016, you would configure April as the first month
and enter 2016 as the Fiscal Year Label.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.019.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.19: Fiscal Year – Period Selector YM
In addition you can configure if the Month should be displayed with the
Month Name or as Month Number.

Additional Properties of Period Selector YM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a custom component the Period Selector YM also comes with a set of
Additional Properties. The Period Selector YM provides Additional
Properties in the categories: General and Appearance. In the following
sections you will find a list of these Additional Properties and a Table
with a more detailed description of each of those.

the option Enable Minimize Maximize. This option will allow the user to
minimize and restore the Period Selector, like a standard window as part
of the Windows operating system (see Figure 5.25).

.. _return-formats-1:

Return Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YQM the dashboard
designer has the option to specify the Return Format of the selected
value. The specified Return Format can then be used as part of the
scripting for the Period Selector and the dashboard designer can use the
returned value in the specified format and use the value as a filter
value for a data source. The Period Selector YQM allows the dashboard
designer to specify a date format from the list of 6 standard return
formats such as YYYYMM, MM.YYYY, YYYYMMM (see Figure 5.18). The
dashboard designer can also define a custom format using the option
“Custom Format”.

The option “Custom Format” allows you to use the following format
options to specify a custom format for the return value:

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Format | Description                                           |
+========+=======================================================+
| m      | Displays the month values as 1 – 12.                  |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| mm     | Displays the month values as 01 – 12.                 |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| mmm    | Displays the month values as Jan – Dec.               |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| mmmm   | Displays the month values as January – December.      |

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| qq     | Displays the quarter values as 01 – 04.               |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| qqq    | Displays the quarter values as Q1 – Q4.               |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| qqqq   | Displays the quarter values as Quarter 1 – Quarter 4. |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------+

Table 5.17: Custom Formats – Period Selector YQM

For Example, a combination of month and year separated by symbols (like
‘-‘, ‘/’, etc.) could be specified as ‘mmm/yyyy’ and such a custom
format would display the value as May/2015.

The Custom Format will be used as the format for the scripting function
.DSXGetSelectedValueInDateFormat().

.. _fiscal-year-definition-1:

Fiscal Year definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the Period Selector component displays the standard calendar
month values from January to December and follows the calendar year. In
case you would like to offset the calendar year to a fiscal year, you
can activate the Fiscal Year option in the Additional Properties (see
Figure 5.19). With the Fiscal Year option you can configure the Starting
Month and the Fiscal Year Label. For example, if April 2015 is the start
of your Fiscal Year 2016, you would configure April as the first month
and enter 2016 as the Fiscal Year Label.

In addition you can configure if the Month should be displayed with the
Month Name or as Month Number.

Table 5.20: Scripting Functions

Returned Values – Month or Quarter

Please note, that the scripts DSXGetSelectedMonth() and
DSXGetSelectedQuarter() will only return values, if a month / quarter
has been selected. For example, if you are selecting a quarter, then the
function DSXGetSelectedMonth() will return null and if you have selected
a month then the function DSXGetSeletedQuarter() will return null.

Returned Values – Custom Format

Similar to the returned values for the month and quarter selection, the
component will return the values in the custom Month / Year format in
case a month was selected and in the custom Quarter / Year format in
cases where a quarter was selected.

Period Selector YQM MultiSelect
-------------------------------

The Period Selector YQM MultiSelect (see Figure 5.30) provides you with
the ability to add a selector to your dashboard which will allow you to
select a value for the year, a quarter, and a value for the month with
one simple control.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.030.jpg

In addition to being able to select a year, quarter, and month, this
component allows you to select multiple values across multiple years.

Features of Period Selector YQM MultiSelect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following sections we will review the features of the Period
Selector YQM MultiSelect.

.. _calendar-limits-2:

Calendar Limits 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YQM MultiSelect in
the category General and the sub category Filter Settings, you have the
option to define the Calendar Limits based on the Current Year and a
defined offset for the start and end year.

For our example, enable the option Enable Offset and set the property
“Start Year Offset” to the value -3 and set the property “End Year
Offset” to the value 3 based on the Current Year 2017 (see Figure 5.31).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.031.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.31: Enable Offset  
Based on the above configuration you will be able to view the Period
Selector YQM MultiSelect as shown in the Figure 5.32 and Figure 5.33.

Our example shows the years from 2014 to 2020, based on the current year
being 2017.

Number of Year Display
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YQM MultiSelect in
the category Filter and the sub category Filter Settings, you have the
option to define the number of Calendar Years in a flexible way beyond a
fixed set of 4 years. For our example the Number of Year Display has
been set to the value 5 (see Figure 5.34).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YQM MultiSelect in
the category Appearance and the sub category Filter, you will be able to
set the layout to the option “Left to Right” as shown in Figure 5.36. By
default, the months in the Period Selector will be displayed from Top to
Bottom order. When the layout is changed to the option “Left to Right”,
then the months in the Period Selector will be displayed from Left to
Right order along with the Quarters being displayed on the left side as
first column.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YQM MultiSelect in
the category Appearance and the sub category Filter, you have the
ability to enable the option Enable Minimize Maximize. This option will
allow the user to minimize and restore the Period Selector, like a
standard window as part of the Windows operating system (see Figure

.. _return-formats-2:

Return Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector YQM MultiSelect the
dashboard designer has the option to specify the Return Format of the
selected value. The specified Return Format can then be used as part of
the scripting for the Period Selector and the dashboard designer can use
the returned value in the specified format and use the value as a filter
value for a data source. The Period Selector YQM MultiSelect allows the
dashboard designer to specify a date format from the list of 6 standard
return formats such as YYYYMM, MM.YYYY, YYYYMMM (see Figure 5.41). The
dashboard designer can also define a custom format using the option
“Custom Format”.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.041.jpg

Table 5.22: Custom Formats – Period Selector YQM

For Example, a combination of month and year separated by symbols (like
‘-‘, ‘/’, etc.) could be specified as ‘mmm/yyyy’ and such a custom
format would display the value as May/2015. The Custom Format will be
used as the format for the scripting function
.DSXGetSelectedValueInDateFormat().

Fiscal Year definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the Period Selector component displays the standard calendar
month values from January to December and follows the calendar year. In
case you would like to offset the calendar year to a fiscal year, you
can activate the Fiscal Year option in the Additional Properties (see
Figure 5.42). With the Fiscal Year option you can configure the Starting
Month and the Fiscal Year Label. For example, if April 2015 is the start
of your Fiscal Year 2016, you would configure April as the first month
and enter 2016 as the Fiscal Year Label.

In addition you can configure if the Month should be displayed with the
Month Name or as Month Number.

Period Selector DWM
-------------------

The Period Selector DWM (see Figure 5.43) provides you with the ability
to add a selector to your dashboard which will allow you to select a
value for the day, a week, a month and a value for the year with one
simple control.

Features of Period Selector DWM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following sections we will review the features of the Period
Selector DWM.

Default Selection and Return Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector DWM the dashboard
designer has the option to specify the Return Format of the selected
value. The specified Return Format can then be used as part of the
scripting for the Period Selector and the dashboard designer can use the
returned value in the specified format and use the value as a filter
value for a data source. The Period Selector DWM allows the dashboard
designer to specify a date format from the list of 8 standard return
formats such as mm/d/yy, mm-dd-yy, m.dd.yy, mmm-yyyy, mmmm-yy-w, DD-yy,
D-yy and w-mmmm-yyyy (see Figure 5.44). The dashboard designer can also
define a custom format using the option “Custom Format”.

.. figure:: _static/images/dwm2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.44: Return Formats – Period Selector DWM
The option “Custom Format” allows you to use the following format
options to specify a custom format for the return value:

+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Format | Description                                      |
+========+==================================================+

+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| mm     | Displays the month values as 01 – 12.            |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| mmm    | Displays the month values as Jan – Dec.          |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| mmmm   | Displays the month values as January – December. |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| d      | Displays the month values as 1 – 30.             |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| dd     | Displays the month values as 01 – 30.            |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| D      | Displays the date values as Mon – Sun.           |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| DD     | Displays the date values as Monday – Sunday.     |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------+
| yy     | Displays the year value as 00 – 99.              |

Calendar Limits and Offset Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Additional Properties of the Period Selector DWM in the category
General and the sub category Filter Settings, you have the option to
define the Calendar Limits for the Staring Month/Year and Ending
Month/Year and define the offset values based on the defined Calendar
Limits. The offset value will react based on the default selection on
day, week and month.

For our example, enable the option Enable Calendar Limits. Set the
property “Starting Month” to the value 2, Starting Year to the value
“2018”, Ending Month to the value 2 and set the property “Ending Year”
to the value “2019”. Now set the property “Offset value” to the value 2
(see Figure 5.45).

.. figure:: _static/images/dwm3.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.45: Enable Calendar Limit and Offset  
Based on the above configuration you will be able to view the Period
Selector DWM as shown in the Figure 5.46. In our example, the Period
Selector DWM shows the 8\ :sup:`th` week since the Offset Value is set
to the value 2 from the current week which falls on 6\ :sup:`th` week
and the calendar limits are defined from Feb 2 2018 to Feb 2 2019 which
is within the range (see Figure 5.46).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Table 5.31: Events

Hierarchical Filter
-------------------

The Hierarchical Filter is a selector component that allows you to
display hierarchical data in an expandable tree view and to use the
displayed hierarchical nodes and leafs for filtering. The component
allows you to make a selection based on hierarchy nodes, hierarchy
leafs, or hierarchy levels.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.043.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.47: Hierarchical Filter 
Search Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hierarchical Filter provides you with a search functionality, which
allows you to search for a particular value across the complete
hierarchy. You can enable / disable the search functionality by
navigating to the category General and to the sub category Filter
Settings in the Additional Properties of the Hierarchical Filter.

Below are some examples for the search functionality:

For our first example, you provide the input as “ch*” and retrieves all
the members that start with letters “ch” across the hierarchy and the
search results are shown by still keeping the hierarchical structure
intact (see Figure 5.48). As you can see the member Asia is shown, even
though it is not matching the search criteria, because the child member
China is matching the search criteria.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.044.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.48: Hierarchical Filter – Search Functionality 
For our second example, when you provide the input as “*ca”, the search
functionality retrieves the members that ends with letters “ca” along
with its hierarchical structure (see Figure 5.49).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.045.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.49: Hierarchical Filter – Search Functionality
Expand Level to Functionality 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hierarchical Filter also provides a Expand Hierarchy to Level
feature, that allows you to configure, how many hierarchical levels
should be leveraged from the assigned hierarchy. This settings is not
configuring the number of levels that will be displayed, but instead you
can configure the number of levels that are being retrieved from the
hierarchical data source. In the following example, we will navigate to
the category General and to the sub category Filter Settings to
configure the property Expand Hierarchy to Level (see Figure 5.50) to
retrieve 2 levels of the hierarchy.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.046.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.50: Hierarchical Filter – Category General 
In addition, the Hierarchical Filter provides the property No of
Hierarchy Level(s) displayed (see Figure 5.50). Using this property you
can decide how many of the available hierarchy levels will be displayed
in the initial view of your dashboard. This does not mean that this is
the number of hierarchy level that is available, but instead it is the
number of hierarchy level that is initially shown (see Figure 5.51).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.047.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.51: Hierarchical Filter -  Expand to Level 
Allow Multi-Select
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By navigating to the category General and to the sub category Filter
Settings, you can activate the property Enable Multi-Select to allow you
to select multiple entries of the hierarchy. In case you are disabling
the property Enable Multi-Select, you will only be able to select a
single node or leaf from the hierarchy filter (see Figure 5.52).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.048.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.52: Category General 
Selection Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By navigating to the category General and to the sub category Filter
Settings, you can activate the property Selection Mode to different
options. The available options are:

-  Self: This option will select only the selected element of the
   hierarchy.

-  Self + Children: This option will select the selected item and any
   applicable children (but not descendants).

-  Self + Children + Descendants: This option will select the item plus
   children and descendants.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.049.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.53: Category General
Level based Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By navigating to the category General and to the sub category Filter
Settings, you can activate the property Enable Level Selection to
enable/disable the option, and to select the hierarchy elements based on
the hierarchy levels (see Figure 5.54).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.050.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.54: Category General
For our example, when the property Enable Level Selection is enabled,
the hierarchical tree appears with the Level tab, and you have now the
option to also select the members of the hierarchy using the level
information (see Figure 5.55)

.. figure:: _static/images/5.051.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.55: Enable Level Selection
Available Hierarchies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to using the hierarchy, which is configured as part of the
Initial View, you can navigate to the category General and to the sub
category Filter Settings in the Additional Properties to configure the
hierarchy by using the property Select Hierarchy. Here you can select
any of the available hierarchies of the configured dimension,
irrespective of the Initial View settings.

For our example, we have configured the dimension Region with the
hierarchy Continent to be used for the Hierarchical Filter (see Figure
5.56).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.052.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.56: Category General
Based on the configuration, you can view the hierarchy Continent when
the hierarchy filter is being loaded (see Figure 5.57).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.053.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.57: Available Hierarchies
Interactive Hierarchy Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By navigating to the category General and to the sub category Filter
Settings, you can activate the property Enable Hierarchy Selection at
Run Time (see Figure 5.58) to allows you at runtime to switch between
any of the available hierarchies from the configured dimension. For
example, in case dimension Region has a total of five hierarchies
available, then you would be able to switch between those five
hierarchies at runtime.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.054.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.58: Category General
For our example, when you enable the property Enable Hierarchy Selection
at Run Time , a drop down with all the available hierarchies will be
displayed at runtime, and you can choose the hierarchy they would like
to see for filtering (see Figure 5.59).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.055.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.59: Interactive Hierarchy Selection
Expand and Collapse Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By navigating to the category Appearance and to the sub category Filter
and to the area Expand & Collapse, you can expand and collapse the
hierarchy with the help of an icon and you have the option to configure
the Icon specifics. (see Figure 5.60).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.056.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.60: Category Appearance
For our example, we set the properties Icon Style to the value Plus
Circle, the property Background Color to the value black, and the
property Icon Size to the value 15 (see Figure 5.60).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.057.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.61: Expand/Collapse
Data Source Requirements for the Hierarchical Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hierarchical Filter component requires a dimension with an activated
hierarchy in the initial view of the data source. In case the data
source contains multiple dimensions with active hierarchies, you will be
able to select the dimension for the Hierarchical Filter in the
Additional Properties.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.058.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.62: Data Source – Hierarchical Filter
How to use the Hierarchical Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we will outline how you can use the Hierarchical Filter
component as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer project and provide your users with the ability to
filter the data by leveraging a true Hierarchical Filter.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.059.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.63: Adding the Data Source
For our example we will assume that we are using a BEx query with the
technical name QUERY1 as data source. Our example query contains
dimension Country in the Rows and a measure in the columns. In addition
a hierarchy has been activated for dimension Country (see Figure 5.63).

You are in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer and you
create a new project and you are adding a new data source to the
project.

1.  You are presented with the connection dialog.

2.  Click **Browse** for the **Connection**.

3.  Select the connection entry **for your SAP BW system**.

4.  Click **OK**.

5.  Click **Browse** for the **Data Source** field.

6.  Select a BEx query with an active hierarchy as your data source. For
    our example we will assume the name of the query is QUERY1.

7.  Click **OK**.

8.  In the **Data Source Alias** field enter **QUERY1** as the alias
    name.

9.  Click **OK**.

10. Select the **Data Source** in the outline.

11. Use a right-click and select the menu **Edit Initial View**.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.060.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.64: Validation of Data Source
12. Ensure that the dimension with the active hierarchy is part of the
    Rows or Columns in the initial view.

13. Click **OK**.

14. Add a **Hierarchical Filter** component from the VBX Selectors onto
    the canvas.

15. Configure the Additional Properties of the Hierarchical Filter as
    follows:

+---------------+---------------------+
| Property      | Value               |
+===============+=====================+
| Name          | HIERARCHICALFILTER1 |
+---------------+---------------------+
| Top Margin    | 10                  |
+---------------+---------------------+
| Left Margin   | 10                  |
+---------------+---------------------+
| Bottom Margin | Auto                |
+---------------+---------------------+
| Right Margin  | Auto                |
+---------------+---------------------+
| Width         | 300                 |
+---------------+---------------------+
| Height        | 500                 |
+---------------+---------------------+
| Data Source   | QUERY1              |
+---------------+---------------------+

Table 5.32: Hierarchical Filter Component Properties

16. Now navigate to the Additional Properties of the Hierarchical
    Filter.

17. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
    Settings.

18. Set the property **Expand Hierarchy to Level** to a number of levels
    that fits your hierarchy. In our example we use the value 10.

19. Select the dimension from the list of available dimensions for the
    property Hierarchy Dimensions.

At this point the Hierarchical Filter component should display the
hierarchy and you should be able to navigate along the hierarchy when
you execute the application.

20. Navigate to the **Outline** of your new application.

21. Select the folder **Data Sources**.

22. Select the data source QUERY1 and use a right-click and select the
    menu Copy.

23. Select the folder Data Sources and use a right-click and select the
    menu Paste.

24. Rename the data source to QUERY2 by using the right-click and
    selecting the menu Rename.

Data Source for Hierarchical Filter

In the above steps you will notice that we use one data source for the
Hierarchical Filter component and one data source for the crosstab.
Reason for doing so, is the situation that the data source for the
crosstab will be filtered based on the values from the Hierarchical
Filter component and in a situation where both components would be based
on a single data source, the values in the Hierarchical Filter would get
filtered as well.

25. Add a **Crosstab** component from the Analytic Components onto the
    canvas.

26. Configure the **Properties** of the **Crosstab** as follows:

+---------------+-----------+
| Property      | Value     |
+===============+===========+
| Name          | CROSSTAB1 |
+---------------+-----------+
| Top Margin    | 600       |
+---------------+-----------+
| Left Margin   | 10        |
+---------------+-----------+
| Bottom Margin | Auto      |
+---------------+-----------+
| Right Margin  | Auto      |
+---------------+-----------+
| Width         | 300       |
+---------------+-----------+
| Height        | 500       |
+---------------+-----------+
| Data Source   | QUERY2    |
+---------------+-----------+

Table 5.33: Crosstab Component Properties

27. Now navigate to the Additional Properties of the Hierarchical
    Filter.

28. Navigate to the category **Scripting** in the Additional Properties.

29. Open the editor for the scripting event **On Select**.

30. Enter the following script:

    QUERY2.setFilter("0D_NW_CNTRY",
    HIERARCHIALFILTER_1.DSXGetSelectedMembersInternalKey());

Sample Data

In this example the dimension name 0D_NW_CNTRY is an example and you
might have to change it to match your data source.

31. Click **OK**.

32. Now save and execute your application.

By following these steps you should now have a Hierarchical Filter that
can be used to filter the data in the crosstab based on the selected
hierarchy nodes and leafs.

Additional Properties of the Hierarchical Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a custom component the Hierarchical Filter also comes with a set of
Additional Properties. The Hierarchical Filter provides Additional
Properties in the categories: General and Appearance. In the following
sections you will find a list of available properties and a Table with a
more detailed description of each of those properties.

Combo Box
---------

Combo Box - Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Combo Box is a filtering component which allows you to setup a list
of members of a dimension, which then will be shown as a drop down box.
The Combo Box provides standard features such as a search option and the
ability to choose – at run time – between the key, text, or key and text
as display option for the dimension members.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.061.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.65: Combo Box
Figure 5.65 shows an opened Combo Box displaying a list of product
categories from a dimension and showing a Search Box as part of the
overall display of the Combo Box.

Sorting in Combo Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the Combo Box in the category Data and
the sub category Data Series, you have the option to sort the list in
the Combo Box.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the Sorting
in Combo Box:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measure Discount Amount and Order Cost
   along the dimension Item Category.

3. Add a Combo Box from the VBX Selectors to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Combo Box.

Figure 5.66: Category Data
8.  For our example, set the property Sorting to the option Ascending.

9.  Set the property Sorting Based On to the option Measure.

10. Set the property Sort Measure to the option Discount Amount.

11. Based on the above configuration, you will be able to visualize the
    Combo Box with the list being displayed based on the ascending order
    of the Measure Discount Amount for the Dimension Item Category (see
    Figure 5.67). Similarly, you can configure the Combo Box List based
    on the sorting order of the Dimension.

.. figure:: _static/images/cbsrt2.jpg
	:align: center

   Order Cost and Order Quantity along the dimension Item Category.

3. Add a Combo Box from the VBX Selectors to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source (DS_1) to the Combo Box.

5. Now add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

6. Assign the same data source (DS_2) to the Column Bar Chart. You can
   also assign different data source having same dimensions but
   different measures.

7. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Combo Box.

8. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

9. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the

Keyboard Navigations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Combo Box Component will be able to support the keyboard navigations
and they will be active only when the property Activate Multiselect is
enabled in the Additional Properties of the Combo Box. All the below
listed keyboard options will be active only when you select at least one
dimension member from the Combo Box through a mouse click.

-  Using Up / Down arrow key navigation to scroll up and scroll down the
   dimension members of the Combo Box.

-  Using SPACE key to de-select the dimension members of the Combo Box.

-  Using CTRL key and a single click on each dimension member for a
   multi-select of dimension members.

-  Using SHIFT and a single click on the other dimension member in case
   of selecting a range of dimension members.

Data Source Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Combo Box is using members of a dimension for the display, therefore
the data source requirements are very simple in that way that the
assigned data source requires at least one dimension in the rows or in
the columns.

How to use the Combo Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following section we will outline the steps that are needed to
setup a Combo Box as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. You will need a data source
available to SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer with
at least one dimension. For our example we assume that we have a data
source in form of a SAP BEx Query with a dimension Product Group.

To setup your first Combo Box follow these steps:

1. Start SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

2. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer select the
   menu Application **•** New.

3. Enter a Name for your new dashboard.

       Initial View of the Data Source.

    -  Dimension Values - Send - Key Type: You can choose between the
       options Default, External Key, External Non-Compounded Key,
       Internal Key and Internal Non-Compounded Key.

    -  Sorting: Here you can configure an ascending or descending sort
       for the dimension members. The basis for the sort depends on
       which values are being displayed.

    -  Minimum Dropdown Size (in px) : Here you can specify a value (in
       px) that is defining the minimum height of the drop down box at
       run-time.

    -  Activate Multi-Select: By activating this option you are allowed
       to select multiple values.

    -  Activate Searching: Here you can activate the search option for
       the Combo Box.

    -  Activate Display Settings: By activating this option you are
       allowed – at run time – to choose between the different display
       options - such as Key, Text, Key and Text – for the dimension
       members at run-time.

    -  Activate Horizontal Scrollbar: Here you can activate the
       Horizontal Scrollbar for the Combo Box.

    -  Activate Vertical Scrollbar: Here you can activate the Vertical

       like to be displayed for the All Member.

    -  All Member Key: Here you can specify the key that you would like
       to be displayed for the All Member.

22. For our example we are using the following configuration:

    -  Display Dimension Values: Text and Key

    -  Dimension Values - Display - Key Type: Default

    -  Dimension Values – Send Type: Key Only

    -  Dimension Values - Send - Key Type: Default

    -  Sorting: Ascending

    -  Minimum Dropdown Size (in px): 300

    -  Activate Multi-Select

    -  Activate Searching

    -  Activate Display Settings

    -  Activate Horizontal Scrollbar

    -  Activate Vertical Scrollbar

    -  Include All Member

    -  All Member Text : All Product Groups

    -  All Member Key: ALL

23. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Filter
    Settings in the Additional Properties (see Figure 5.81).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.074.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.81: Category Data 
24. In the sub category Filter Settings you can configure the following
    items:

    -  Select Source Dimension: Here you can select the dimension which
       will be used for the list of members in the Combo Box.

    -  Maximum Number of Members: The default Number of Members will be
       100. If needed, you can enter a maximum value of dimension
       members here.

    -  Default Selection (Key Value): Here you can set the default
       selected item for the Combo Box.

    -  Target Data Source(s): Here you can enter the technical name of
       all the data sources which should be filtered based on the
       selected values in the Combo Box. You can enter multiple data
       sources with a “,” as separator. The Combo Box will send the
       selected values as filter values to the target data source based
       on the assigned dimension.

    -  Enable Static Data: By activating the option Enable Static Data
       you can manually enter values using the Text and Key options and
       use the manually entered values for the Combo Box.

25. For our example we are configuring these properties as follows:

    -  Select Source Dimension: Product Group

    -  Maximum Number of Members: We will leave this empty as we do not
       want to specify a limit.

    -  Default Selection (Key Value): For our example this stays empty.

    -  Target Data Source(s): For our example this stays empty as we
       only have one data source so far.

26. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Filter
    (see Figure 5.82).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.075.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.82: Category Appearance
27. In the sub category Filter you can configure the look and feel of
    the Combo Box.

28. Now navigate to the category Scripting (see Figure 5.83).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.076.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.83: Category Scripting
29. In the category Scripting you have access to the different scripting
    events support by the component and you can use the button on the
    right hand side to open the script editor.

30. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Conditional
    Formatting (see Figure 5.84).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.077.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.84: Category Data
31. In the sub category Conditional Formatting you have the option to
    add rules which allow you to define highlighting for the dimension
    members displayed in the Combo Box. For example, you could display a
    red arrow in front of those Product Groups that are not achieving
    the revenue forecast, so that you receive an additional visual clue
    and does not have to scroll down the complete list of Product
    Groups.

32. In our example we assigned the data source and we selected the
    dimension for the Combo Box, so our Combo Box looks like this so
    far.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.078.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.85: Combo Box
As you can see we have a Combo Box displaying the members of dimension
Product Group as well as showing the All member with the text we
specified. In addition we have the search option as well as the option
to choose between the different display options.

List Box
--------

List Box - Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The List Box is a filtering component which allows you to setup a list
of members of a dimension, which then will be shown as a static box. The
List Box – slightly different to the Combo Box – will consume a static
space based on how the List Box has been configured in SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer. The List Box provides
standard features such as a search option and the ability to choose – at
run time – between the key, text, or key and text as display option for
the dimension members.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.085.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.92: List Box
Figure 5.92 shows a List Box displaying a list of product categories
from a dimension and showing a Search Box and the option to change the
display of the dimension members as part of the overall display of the
List Box.

Sorting in List Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the List Box in the category Data and
the sub category Data Series, you have the option to sort the list in
the List Box.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the Sorting
in List Box:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measure Discount Amount and Order Cost
   along the dimension Item Category.

3. Add a List Box from the VBX Selectors to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the List Box.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the List Box.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the
   sub category Data Series (see Figure 5.93).

.. figure:: _static/images/ltsrt1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.93: Category Data
8.  For our example, set the property Sorting to the option Ascending.

9.  Set the property Sorting Based On to the option Measure.

10. Set the property Sort Measure to the option Discount Amount.

11. Based on the above configuration, you will be able to visualize the
    List Box with the list being displayed based on the ascending order
    of the Measure Discount Amount for the Dimension Item Category (see
    Figure 5.94). Similarly, you can configure the List Box List based
    on the sorting order of the Dimension.

.. figure:: _static/images/ltsrt1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.93: Category Data
The ascending order of the Measure Discount Amount for the Dimension
Item Category can be viewed from the Initial View settings as part of
our understanding (see Figure 5.95).

custom data sources.

.. _checkbox-for-multi-select-display-1:

Checkbox for Multi-select display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the List Box in the category General and
the sub category Filter Settings, you have the option to add a check box
for a multi select display of the dimension members.

For our example, activate the option Activate Multi-Select and then
activate the option Activate Inline Checkbox (see Figure 5.96).

.. _new-conditional-formatting-rules-for-alerts-1:

New Conditional Formatting Rules for Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the List Box in the category Data and
the sub category Conditional Formatting, you have the option to filter
the list based on the conditional formatting rules. Here you can assign
the icons for the Alert items based on the conditional formatting and
also can select only the alert items alone to be displayed in the List
Box.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the
Conditional Formatting for Alerts based on a Single Measure:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measure Order Cost along the dimension Item
   Category.

3. Add a List Box from the VBX Selectors to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the List Box.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the List Box.

8.  Now click on Create Rule (see Figure 5.99)

9.  Enter a Rule Name for your Rule.

10. In our example we are setting up an alert based on the Rule Type
    Single Measure: (see Figure 5.99)

    -  Rule Type Single Measure

    -  Select Measure Order Cost

    -  Comparison Operator Greater Than

    -  Comparison Value Type Dynamic

    -  Comparison Value Order Cost

    -  Color Red

    -  Alert Icon hourglass-half

    -  Icon size 15

    -  Icon Angle 0 degree

.. _option-to-filter-the-target-data-source-using-additional-properties-1:

Option to filter the Target Data Source using Additional Properties 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Additional Properties of the List Box in the category General and
the sub category Filter Settings, you have the option to filter the
Target Data Source(s) directly using the Additional Properties.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to filter the Target
Data Source(s):

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows the measures Discount Amount, Order Amount,
   Order Cost and Order Quantity along the dimension Item Category.

3. Add a List Box from the VBX Selectors to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source (DS_1) to the List Box.

5. Now add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Charts to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

6. Assign the same data source (DS_2) to the Column Bar Chart. You can
   also assign different data source having same dimensions but
   different measures.

7. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the List Box.

8. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

9. In the Additional Properties navigate to the category Data and to the
   sub category Filter Settings. Now set the property Target Data
   Source(s) to the value DS_2 (see Figure 5.102).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.092.jpg
	:align: center

.. _keyboard-navigations-1:

Keyboard Navigations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The List Box Component will be able to support the keyboard navigations
and they will be active only when the property Activate Multiselect is
enabled in the Additional Properties of the List Box. All the below
listed keyboard options will be active only when you select at least one
dimension member from the List Box through a mouse click.

-  Using Up / Down arrow key navigation to scroll up and scroll down the
   dimension members of the List Box.

-  Using SPACE key to de-select the dimension members of the List Box.

-  Using CTRL key and a single click on each dimension member for a
   multi-select of dimension members.

-  Using SHIFT and a single click on in the other dimension member in
   case of selecting a range of dimension members.

.. _data-source-requirements-1:

Data Source Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The List Box is using members of a dimension for the display, therefore
the data source requirements are very simple in that way that the
assigned data source requires at least one dimension in the rows or in
the columns.

How to use the List Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline the steps that are needed to
setup a List Box as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. You will need a data source
available to SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer with
at least one dimension. For our example we assume that we have a data
source in form of a SAP BEx Query with a dimension Product Group.

To setup your first List Box follow these steps:

Figure 5.108: Category Data 
24. In the sub category Filter Settings you can configure the following
    items:

    -  Select Source Dimension: Here you can select the dimension which
       will be used for the list of members in the List Box.

    -  Maximum Number of Members: The default Number of Members will be
       100. If needed, you can enter a maximum value of dimension
       members here.

    -  Default Selection (Key Value): Here you can set the default
       selected item for the List Box.

    -  Target Data Source(s): Here you can enter the technical name of
       all the data sources which should be filtered based on the
       selected values in the List Box. You can enter multiple data
       sources with a “,” as separator. The List Box will send the
       selected values as filter values to the target data source based
       on the assigned dimension.

    -  Enable Static Data: By activating the option Enable Static Data
       you can manually enter values using the Text and Key options and
       use the manually entered values for the List Box.

25. For our example we are configuring these properties as follows:

    -  Select Source Dimension: Product Group

    -  Maximum Number of Members: We will leave this empty as we do not
       want to specify a limit.

    -  Default Selection (Key Value): For our example this stays empty.

    -  Target Data Source(s): For our example this stays empty as we
       only have one data source so far. .

26. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Filter
    (see Figure 5.109).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.099.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.109: Category Appearance
27. In the sub category Filter you can configure the look and feel of
    the List Box.

28. Now navigate to the category Scripting (see Figure 5.110).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.100.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.110: Category Scripting
29. In the category Scripting you have access to the different scripting
    events supported by the component and you can use the button on the
    right hand side to open the script editor.

30. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Conditional
    Formatting (see Figure 5.111).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.101.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.111: Category Data
31. In the sub category Conditional Formatting you have the option to
    add rules, which allow you to define highlighting for the dimension
    members displayed in the List Box. For example, you could display a
    red arrow in front of those Product Groups that are not achieving
    the revenue forecast, so that you receive an additional visual clue
    and does not have to scroll down the complete list of Product
    Groups.

32. In our example we assigned the data source and we selected the
    dimension for the List Box, so our List Box looks like this so far.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.102.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.112: List Box
As you can see we have a List Box displaying the members of dimension
Product Group as well as showing the All member with the text we
specified (see Figure 5.112). In addition we have the search option as
well as the option to choose between the different display options.

In the next section we will outline the steps to setup an Alert based on
the Rule Type Single Measure for the List Box. We will assume that our
data source has a dimension Product Group and the measures Revenue,
Profit, and Cost.

1. With the previously configured List Box in SAP BusinessObjects Design
   Studio/SAP Lumira Designer, navigate to the category Data and to the
   sub category Conditional Formatting in the Additional Properties of
   the List Box (see Figure 5.113).

Facet Filter
------------

Facet Filter - Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Facet Filter is a selector component with advanced filtering
capabilities. The Facet Filter allows you to display a set of dimension
members in form of facets, together with a list of available measures.
One of the key features of the Facet Filter is the fact, that all facets
are working in a cascading style, meaning that when selecting the
Product Group member Cameras (see Figure 5.119), all other facets will
automatically filter the list of members to the Product Group member
Cameras, without the need for any additional scripting. In addition the
Facet Filter provides the ability to quickly select values and filter a
target data source based on the selection.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.109.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.119: Facet Filter
In Figure 5.119 we see a Facet Filter component with a total of four
facets, one facet showing the list of available measures and three
additional facets showing the members for dimension Product Group,
Product Category, and Product.

Facet Filter Data Volume

The Facet Filter is configured to be able to leverage 500.000 cells from
the assigned data source. For SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer to leverage more than the default of 10.000 cells for
SDK components an additional parameter needs to be configured in case of
SAP BW as data source. The parameter AAD_SDK_MAX_CELLS needs to be
maintained with the value. You can see the details on how to maintain
the value in SAP Note 1127156 and you can follow the steps for
configuring the SAP BW safety belt.

Integrated Search Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the Integrated Search option, you can perform a search across all
configured facets with all their members. For our example, we search for
items having the letters “al”, then all the items with the letters “al”
will be highlighted (see Figure 5.120). By navigating to the category
General and to the sub category Filter Settings in the Additional
Properties of the Facet Filter, you have the option to enable / disable
the search option using the property Enable Global Search Box.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.110.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.120: Integrated Search
Hierarchy Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release VBX 1.68, the Facet Filter also supports
hierarchies from SAP BW and SAP HANA.

The Hierarchy Support for Facet Filters also involves the following
functionalities.

-  You will have the ability to specify the maximum level of depth for
   the hierarchy. In Figure 5.121, you can observe that 2 levels of the
   hierarchy have been configured for the dimension Region.

-  Inside the Facet Filter you have the ability to open / close the
   different levels of the hierarchy at runtime. In Figure 5.121, you
   can observe, that when you click the circle icon next to hierarchy
   node element, you can drill down to the next level of elements.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.111.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.121: Hierarchy Support
Facet Filter Configuration Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release VBX 1.68, you have the option to enable the option
to select the dimensions for the Facet Filter at Runtime (when the
overall dashboard is executed). You can then simply decide, which of the
available dimensions will be part of the Facet Filter (see Figure
5.122). By navigating to the category General and to the sub category
Filter Settings in the Additional Properties, this new functionality can
be enabled / disabled using the property Enable Dimension Configuration.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.112.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.122: Facet Filter Configuration Dialog 
Intuitive Coloring for Focused Facet Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the option of coloring the selected elements in a facet,
the Facet Filter now also provides additional options to color elements,
such as the selected elements, or elements for an alternative selection.

You have the following options:

-  Configuring a Background Color and Font Color for the SELECTED
   members of the facet. For our example, the Font Color for the
   SELECTED items is Pink and the Background Color is Purple (see Figure
   5.123).

-  Configuring a Background Color and Font Color for the POSSIBLE
   members that you can still select based on the overall combined
   filter values in the Facet Filter. For our example, the Font Color
   for the POSSIBLE items is Orange and the Background Color is Green.

-  Configuring a Background Color and Font Color for the ALTERNATIVE
   members that you can still add to the selection. For our example, the
   Font Color for the SELECTED items is Pink and the Background Color is
   Maroon.

-  Configuring a background color and Font Color for the EXCLUDED
   members that cannot be selected by you anymore based on the overall
   context. For our example, Font Color for the EXCLUDED items is Blue
   and the background color is Grey.

By navigating to the category General and to the sub category Filter
Settings in the Additional Properties, you can enable / disable this
option using the property Enable Focused Selection. The individual
settings can be found by navigating to the category Appearance and to
the sub category Focused Selection.

Figure 5.123: Facet Filter Style
Data Source Details for the Facet Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Facet Filter component requires a data source with a minimum of one
dimension and one measure. There is no limit on the number of dimensions
or measures that you could display as part of the Facet Filter. In the
configuration of the Facet Filter you can then choose which of the
dimensions of the assigned data source you would like to display as part
of the Facet Filter.

How to use the Facet Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we will outline how you can use the Facet Filter
component as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
Lumira Designer project and provide you with the ability to filter the
data of a target data source. For the following steps we assume that we
have a data source with three dimensions Product Category, Product
Group, and Product as well as a set of three measures – Net Value,
Profit, and Cost.

You can follow the steps below to create your first Facet Filter:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a Facet Filter from the VBX Selectors to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

3. Add a data source to your project.

4. The data source can have multiple dimensions and measures.

5. Assign the data source to the filter.

6. After the data source is assigned to the Facet Filter component, the
   component will display the dimensions and list of measures as
   individual facets (see Figure 5.124).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.114.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.124: Facets
Figure 5.124 shows a Facet Filter component with one facet for the Key
Figures and three additional facet for the dimensions Product Group,
Product Category, and Product. Each of the dimension facets include the
option to choose an All member and the dimension members are displayed
in form of a list.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility
   (see Figure 5.125) in the Additional Properties of the Facet Filter.
   In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.115.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.125: Category Data 
8.  The Select Aggregate Function property allows you to choose the
    aggregation for the Facets. For our example we will use the option
    Sum.

9.  By navigating to the category Data and to the sub category Filter
    Settings, the Target Data Source property allows you to specify
    those data source that will be filtered based on the selected values
    in the Facet Filter. You can enter a single or multiple single data
    sources. In case of multiple data sources, please separate the
    technical names by a “comma”.

10. For our example we will leave the Target Data source value empty for
    now.

11. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Filter
    in the Additional Properties (see Figure 5.126).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.116.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.126: Category Appearance
12. In the area General Settings you have the option to configure items
    such as the Font, Font Style, Font size, Background color, etc. for
    the different parts of the Facet Filter component.

13. Now navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
    Settings (see Figure 5.127).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.117.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.127: Category General
14. The sub category Filter Settings allows you to define which facet
    will be displayed as part of the overall Facet Filter and gives you
    the option to configure the details for each of the facets.

15. You can configure the following properties:

    -  *Height(%)*: Here you can configure the Height of the facet as
       percentage value of the total height of the overall Facet Filter
       component. When the Layout Type is set to Horizontal, the Height
       of the facet automatically sets to 100%.

    -  *Width(%)*: Here you can configure the Width of the facet as
       percentage value of the total width of the overall Facet Filter
       component. When the Layout Type is set to Vertical, the Width of
       the facet automatically sets to 100%.

    -  *Display Value Type*: Here you can configure if the dimension
       members should be displayed as Key Only, Text Only, Key & Text,
       or Text & Key.

    -  *Key Type:* Here you can set the option for Display Key Type. The
       options are Default, External Key, External Non-Compounded Key,
       Internal Key and Internal Non-Compounded Key.

    -  *Send Value Type:* Here you can set the option for Send Value
       Type. The options are Key Only, Text Only, Key & Text, or Text &
       Key.

    -  *Send Key Type:* Here you can set the option for Send Key Type.
       The options are Default, External Key, External Non-Compounded
       Key, Internal Key and Internal Non-Compounded Key.

    -  *Control Type*: The Control property allows you to choose the
       type of visual control for the dimension members. You can choose
       between List, Radio Button, Check Box, Chosen.

    -  *Sort Order*: Here you can configure an ascending or descending
       sort for the dimension members.

    -  *Sort Based On*: Here you can figure if the sort will be based on
       the Key, Text, or the Measure value.

    -  *Facet Header*: The Title property allows you to reword the
       header text for the facet. The default value will be the name of
       the dimension.

    -  *Header Position*: This property allows you to configure a Top or
       Bottom alignment of the facet header.

    -  *Enable All Member*: This property allows you to enable / disable
       the display of an All Member for the facet. The All Member will
       be presented with the text “All” and allows you to select all
       members of the dimension with a single click.

    -  *Visible*: Here you can enable/disable the property Visible.

    -  *Activate Search / Sorting*: Here you can activate the search
       option for the facet.

So far we reviewed the different options and properties, so now let’s
create a concrete example. For our example we will assume that we have a
data source with three measures – Cost, Net Value, and Profit – as well
as three dimensions – Product Group, Product Category, and Product.

1. Add the Facet Filter to the project in SAP BusinessObjects Design
   Studio/SAP Lumira Designer and assign the data source.

2. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
   Settings.

3. Ensure that the property Visible is activated for the Key Figures
   facet (see Figure 5.128).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.118.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.128: Key Figures Facet

Range Slider
------------

Range Slider - Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Range Slider component provides you with the capability to create
either a single or a dual slider which can be based on static
information, date values, or data from the assigned data source. In
addition to the option of defining a single or dual slider based on the
different data options, the Range Slider provides the ability to setup a
conditional formatting for different areas of the slider component, such
as the scale background, the range background, or the slider handle.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.127.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.137: Range Slider
Figure 5.137 shows a Range Slider based on static data, showing a dual
slider with a value range from 0 to 100 and a selected value range from
20 to 80.

Data Source requirements for the Range Slider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Range Slider is able to work with static information and therefore
the Range Slider is able to work without any data source assignment. The
Range Slider is offering three options: Number, Date, and Data Points
and the options Number and Date do not require a data source. In case of
the Data Points option the Range Slider requires a data source with at
least a single dimension as part of the assigned data source.

How to use the Range Slider – Number Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following section we will outline the steps that are required to
setup a new Range Slider as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project based on static numeric data.

To create a new Range Slider follow these steps:

1. Start SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

2. Add a new Range Slider from the VBX Selectors to your project.

3. For our example we do not need a data source because the Range Slider
   will be based on static information.

4. Select the Range Slider and navigate to the Additional Properties. In
   case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View • Additional Properties to activate the display.

5. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
   Settings (see Figure 5.138).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.128.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.138: Category General
6. In the area General Settings you can decide if you would like to
   create a Single slider or a Dual Slider. For our example we will
   configure the option Dual.

7. In addition you can decide if you would like to setup a Horizontal or
   a Vertical slider and if you would like to use a normal direction –
   meaning going from left to right – or if you would like to reverse
   the direction. In our example we will setup a Horizontal slider with
   a Normal direction.

8. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Slider
   configuration.

9. In the area Live Data, set the Data Type property to the option
   Number. This option allows you to base the Range Slider on static
   information (see Figure 5.139).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.129.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.139: Category Data
10. You can now enter a minimum and a maximum value for the Range Slider
    using the Minimum Value and Maximum Value properties. For our
    example we will enter 0 for the Minimum Value and 200 for the
    Maximum Value.

11. The properties Default Start and Default End allow you to configure
    a set of default values that will be used when the Range Slider is
    shown initially. You do have the option to activate the Min and Max
    options, which would then use the minimum and maximum values as the
    default values for the initial start (see Figure 5.139).

12. You can also configure the number of decimals for any numeric values
    and you can configure the size of the slider step. The Slider Step
    property defines how many values the slider will move forward or
    backward with a single click (see Figure 5.138).

13. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
    Settings. In the area General Settings, the properties Minimum
    Distance and Maximum Distance between Handles allow you to define a
    minimum size or a maximum size of the range in case you are using a
    Dual slider. These properties allow you to configure boundary
    conditions for the range that you will be able to select. For our
    example we leave both of these properties to the value 0, which
    means that these properties will not impact our Range Slider (see
    Figure 5.138).

14. Navigate to the category Data (see Figure 5.140).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.130.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.140: Category Data 
In our example we did not assign a data source to the Range Slider and
therefore the options listed in the category Data are not relevant for
now, but we will discuss them in a later section.

15. Navigate to the category Appearance in the Additional Properties
    (see Figure 5.141).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.131.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.141: Category Appearance
In the category Appearance you can configure the look and feel for each
element of the slider, such as the Border, the Slider, and the Slider
Handle. For our example we will use the default values for now.

16. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
    Settings. (see Figure 5.142).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.132.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.142: Category General
In the area Title you can enter a text for the Slider Title, as well as
configure properties such as the Font Color, and Font Size for the title
text.

17. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Value
    Label (see Figure 5.143).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.133.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.143: Category Appearance
In the area General you can define the look and feel of the Tooltip of
the Range Slider with properties such as the font size, font color,
alignment, and offset options.

18. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Value
    Axis (see Figure 5.144).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.134.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.144: Category Appearance
In the sub category Value Axis you can define the details of the slider
axis with elements such as major and minor ticks, and tick labels.

19. For our example we are activating the Major and Minor Ticks and we
    are setting the Major Ticks Interval to the value 5 and the Minor
    Ticks Interval to the value 1.

20. At this point we have a Range Slider that looks similar to Figure
    5.145.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.135.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.145: Range Slider
21. Navigate to the category Scripting (see Figure 5.146).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.136.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.146: Category Scripting
22. In the Scripting category you can now add scripting code to – for
    example – retrieve the set values of your new Range Slider.

23. Click next to the property On Change and use the button on the right
    hand side to open the script editor.

24. Now enter the following scripting code:

APPLICATION.alert(

RANGESLIDER_1.DSXGetSelectedValues(0)

+ " to " +

RANGESLIDER_1.DSXGetSelectedValues(1)

);

Script Details

The script show above will receive the selected values from the Range
Slider handles and then display the two values in form of an alert
message.

25. Click OK to close the scripting editor.

26. Navigate to the menu Application • Save.

27. Select the menu Application • Execute Locally.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.137.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.147: Range Slider
Your Range Slider should be shown in a browser windows and each time you
navigate one of the slider handles you will receive an alert message
with the current range values as message text (see Figure 5.147).

How to use the Range Slider – Number Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to using the Range Slider with type Number based on static
information, you can also configure the type Number to be based on an
assigned data source.

To create a new Range Slider with type Number based on a data source,
please follow these steps:

1. Start SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

2. Add a new Range Slider from the VBX Selectors to your project.

3. Add a data source to your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
   Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Range Slider.

5. Select the Range Slider and navigate to the Additional Properties. In
   case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View • Additional Properties to activate the display.

6. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
   Settings.

7. In the area General Settings set the Slider Type property to the
   value Dual.

8. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Slider
   Configuration (see Figure 5.148).

9. In the area Live Data set the Data Type property to the option
   Number.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.138.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.148: Category Data 
10. You can now use the Select Dimension / Measure property to select a
    key figure from the underlying data source as source for the Range
    Slider.

11. Select the option Key Figure for the property Select Dimension /
    Measure.

12. Click on the option Sub Filter and select a Key Figure from the
    assigned data source.

13. You can now use the options in the Live Data area to define the
    details:

    -  Fetch Minimum Value: By activating this option the Range Slider
       will use the minimum value based on the assigned key figure as
       minimum value for the slider.

    -  Minimum Value Data Selection: This option allows you to select a
       data cell from the assigned data source as minimum value for the
       Range Slider.

    -  Fetch Maximum Value: By activating this option the Range Slider
       will use the maximum value based on the assigned key figure as
       maximum value for the slider.

    -  Maximum Value Data Selection: This option allows you to select a
       data cell from the assigned data source as maximum value for the
       Range Slider.

14. Activate the option to fetch the minimum and maximum value based on
    the assigned data source.

You should now have a Range Slider of type Number based on key figure
values from an assigned data source.

How to use the Range Slider – Data Points Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following section we will outline the steps that are required to
setup a new Range Slider as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project based on an assigned data source. For
our example we will configure the Range Slider to leverage a dimension
from an assigned data source. We will use a data source which contains
one dimension and two measures. Our data set looks similar to the Table
shown below.

+-----------+---------+------+
| Product   | Revenue | Cost |
+===========+=========+======+
| Product A | 947     | 60   |
+-----------+---------+------+
| Product B | 1044    | 58   |
+-----------+---------+------+
| Product C | 991     | 57   |
+-----------+---------+------+
| Product D | 945     | 53   |
+-----------+---------+------+
| Product C | 568     | 71   |
+-----------+---------+------+

Table 5.62: Sample Dataset

To create a new Range Slider follow these steps:

1. Start SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

2. Add a new Range Slider from the VBX Selectors to your project.

3. Assign the data source to the Range Slider.

4. Select the Range Slider and navigate to the Additional Properties. In
   case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display.

5. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
   Settings.

6. In the area General Settings set the Slider Type to the option
   Single.

7. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Slider
   Configuration.

8. In the area Live Data set the Data Type property to the option Data
   Points. This option allows you to base the Range Slider either on
   manually entered data or use a data source in combination with the
   Range Slider (see Figure 5.153).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.143.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.153: Slider Type – Data Points
9.  In case you would like to use static information, you can use the
    Add Data Points option now to manually enter data.

10. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Slider
    Configuration(see Figure 5.154).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.144.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.154: Category Data 
11. In the area Live Data you can now configure the property Select
    Dimension / Measure.

12. You have the following options available to you:

    -  Dimensions: Using this option you can select one of the available
       dimension from the assigned data source and the member of the
       dimension will be used to define the Range Slider.

    -  Dimension List: Using this option the Range Slider will be
       configured with the list of dimensions as the scale.

13. Set the option Select Dimension / Measure to the value Dimensions.

14. Click on the Sub Filter (see Figure 5.155).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.145.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.155: Select Dimension
15. You can now select a dimension from the list of available dimensions
    based on the data source. In our example we will select dimension
    Product.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.146.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.156: Range Slider
16. The Range Slider will display all the dimension members and you are
    now able to navigate between those members and use the selected
    dimension member for filtering.

How to use the Range Slider – Conditional Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following section we will outline the steps that are required to
setup a Conditional Formatting for a Range Slider based on static
numeric data. The steps for the Conditional Formatting are similar for
the other types of Range Slider – Data Points and Date – and can be
applied to the slider in a similar way.

To create a new Range Slider follow these steps:

1.  Start SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

2.  Add a new Range Slider from the VBX Selectors to your project.

3.  For our example we do not need a data source because the Range
    Slider will be based on static information.

4.  Select the Range Slider and navigate to the Additional Properties.
    In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display.

5.  Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
    Settings.

6.  In the area General Settings set the Slider Type to a Dual slider.

7.  Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Slider
    Configuration.

8.  In the area Live Data set the Data Type property to the option
    Number. This option allows you to base the Range Slider on static
    information.

9.  Enter 0 for the Minimum Value and 200 for the Maximum Value.

10. Set the Default Start property to the value 50.

11. Set the Default End property to the value 100.

12. Navigate to the category Data.

13. Scroll down to the sub category Conditional Formatting (see Figure
    5.157).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.147.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.157: Conditional Formatting
14. Activate the option Enable Conditional Formatting.

15. You can configure different Target Elements as part of the
    conditional formatting:

    -  Handle Background

    -  Tooltip Background

    -  Scale Background

    -  Range Background

1. For our example we will use the option Scale Background for the
   property Target Element

2. The property Type provides you with three options to define the
   Conditional Formatting:

   -  By Value: Here you can define numeric ranges.

   -  By Percent: Here you can define ranges based on percentage values
      in relation to the maximum.

   -  By Target Percent: Here you can enter a Target Value and then
      define ranges based on percentage values in relation to the
      defined Target Value.

3. For our example we will use the option By Percent (see Figure 5.158).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.148.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.158: Conditional Formatting By Percent
4. Click Create Rule (see Figure 5.159).

.. figure:: _static/images/5.149.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.159: Conditional Formatting Rule
5. You can now setup multiple rules and define a color for the scale
   background for each of the rules.

6. For our example we will setup the following rules: (see Figure 5.160)

   -  From value 0 to value 25 we will show color red.

   -  From value 26 to value 50 we will show color orange.

   -  From value 51 to value 75 we will show color yellow.

   -  From value 76 to value 100 we will show color green.

.. figure:: _static/images/5.150.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.160: Conditional Formatting Rules
7. After this configuration our Range Slider should look similar to
   Figure 5.161.

Time Slicer – Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently the Range Slider allows the user to choose between Number,
Date, and Live data and the user can then set either a single value or a
range for the slider. As part of VBX 2.3, a new VBX Component Time
Slicer has been included which has the ability to select an "operator"
type in a Calendar View as part of the configuration. It includes the
below listed operator functions:

-  Between

-  After

-  Before

-  Last

-  Next

-  This

-  Period

How to use the Time Slicer 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following section we will outline the steps that are required to
setup a new Time Slicer as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

To create a new Time Slicer, follow these steps:

1. Start SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

2. Add a new Time Slicer from the VBX Selectors to your project.

3. For our example we do not need a data source because the Time Slicer
   will be based on static information.

4. Select the Time Slicer and navigate to the Additional Properties. In
   case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View • Additional Properties to activate the display.

5. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category Filter
   Settings (see Figure 5.163).

.. figure:: _static/images/tslicer1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 5.163: Category General
6.  In the sub category Filter Settings you can configure the settings
    for the Time Slicer (see Figure 5.163).

7.  Now set the property Current Type to the value “Next”. The other
    options are Between, After, Before, Last, This and Period.

8.  Set the property Number of Intervals to the value 7.

9.  Set the property Next Range Default to the value Day(s). The other
    options are Week(s), Month(s), Quarter(s) and Year(s).

10. Set the property Week Start to the value Monday. The other options
    are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

11. Set the property Date Format to the value DD-MM-YYYY. The other
    options are MM-DD-YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, MM, MMMM, YY, YYYY, DD, DDDD and
    Custom. You can also set the Custom Date Format.

12. Navigate to the category Appearance in the Additional Properties
    (see Figure 5.164).

13. Set the property Time Slicer Font Size to the value 15.

.. figure:: _static/images/tslice3.jpg
	:align: center

Configuration of Time Slicer using Scripting Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. For our next example to illustrate the Time Slicer component using
   scripting part, create a new layout in SAP BusinessObjects Design
   Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project and assign the VBX Components -
   Time Slicer and a Line Chart to the project. Assign a data source to
   the Line Chart where the data source has Calendar Days as Dimensions
   and Progress Values as Measures.

2. Now navigate to the category Scripting in the Additional Properties
   of the Time Slicer.

3. Use the below script for the event On Change:

var a = TIMESLICER_1.DSXGetResultArray();

var value = "";

a.forEach(function(element, index) {

if (value=="")

{

value=element;

}

});

APPLICATION.alert(value);

DS_1.setFilterExt("0CALDAY",value);

4. Based on the above scripting part, you will be able to view the Time
   Slicer function for the operator type “After” (see Figure 5.177).
   Here you can observe that the Line Chart will be configured for the
   dates from 04/01/2017 to 05/23/2017 since the data source has the
   year values for the calendar year 2017 and months upto May 2017.
   Similarly you can configure the Time Slicer for different operators
   using the scripting event.

KPI Tile
--------

The KPI Tile allows the dashboard designer to create a tile to display
critical measures in combination with elements such as a sparkline chart
to visualize a trend and other elements such as an alert, icon, header,
and footer text. (see Figure 6.9). Figure 6.9 shows the layout of the
KPI Tile with all the different elements that can be inserted into the
different areas of the KPI Tile.

Advanced KPI Tile

Please note, that with release 1.5 and higher of the Visual BI
Extensions you also have the option to use the Advanced KPI Tile, which
provides superior functionality.

Table 6.21: Scripting Functions

Table
-----

The Table provides the dashboard designer with a Table component with an
advanced set of features, such as sorting, integrated search, alerting,
calculations, and easy formatting (see Figure 6.15).

Figure 6.15:  Table
Features of the Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Table component is offering several features, which are explained in
the sections below.

Search
^^^^^^

The search feature in the Table allows the end users to search and
filter rows of data in the Table based on the entered search text.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.016.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.16: Search
The search feature can be enabled and configured by following the
guidelines given below:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to your project.

3. Add a Table from the VBX Utilities category to your project.

4. Assign the data source to the Table component.

5. Navigate to the category **General** and to sub category **General
   Settings** in the Additional Properties sheet (see Figure 6.17)

.. figure:: _static/images/6.017.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.17: General Properties
6. Activate the option **Enable Search Box.**

7. As soon as the search option is activated, a search text box appears
   above the Table (see Figure 6.16).

8. At run-time whenever the user types a search text, the component
   performs an incremental search based on the letters typed and lists
   only those rows that contain a match.

9. The search is not specific to a particular column. For Example, if
   the search text is ‘Administration’, then no matter where the word
   appears in the Table, the row will be filtered for display.

Sorting
^^^^^^^

The Sort feature in the Table allows the end users to sort all the
columns of the Table independent of each other. Sorting can either be
ascending or descending. Also, sorting can be applied either on
dimension alphabetically or key figures numerically. The feature also
contains an option to clear all sorting applied previously on the Table.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.018.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.18: Sorting
To enable and configure the sort feature for the Table you can follow
the steps below:

1. Navigate to the category **General** and to sub category **General
   Settings** in the Additional Properties sheet.

2. Activate the option Enable Interactive Sorting.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.019.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.19: Sorting Options
3. As soon as the sort option is activated, three buttons appear on the
   header area of each column of the Table (see Figure 6.19).

   a. The **up-arrow** button is to sort the rows ascending.

   b. The **down-arrow** button sorts the rows descending.

   c. The **X** button clears any sorting that was applied to the
      column.

Paging
^^^^^^

Pagination in the Table allows the users to navigate easily between
pages of data without scrolling up or down. The feature can be activated
and configured by enabling the set of options as given below:

1. Navigate to the category **General** and to the sub category
   **Table** **Paging** category in the Additional Properties sheet.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.020.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.20: Paging Properties
2. Activate the option **Activate Table Paging**.

3. You can enter the number of rows shown per page with the property
   **No. of Rows / page** (see Figure 6.20).

4. The property **Placement of Page Navigator** allows you to choose to
   provide a page navigation for the user on top of the Table or below
   the Table.

5. The property **Style of Page Navigator** allows you to choose between
   a Button display and a Number display for the set of pages.

6. The property **Repeat Column Header** allows you to enable the option
   to repeat the Table header on each page.

Figure 6.21 shows a Table with an activate Paging option where the Page
Navigation is shown in form of buttons above the Table.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.021.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.21: Paging
Freeze Column Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Table component provides the ability to Freeze the Table header row,
so that in case you provide the ability for the user to use a vertical
scrollbar, the user will always see the header row of the Table.

You can activate the option to Freeze the Table header by following
these steps:

1. Navigate to the category **General** and to sub category **General
   Settings** in the Additional Properties sheet.

2. Activate the option **Freeze Column Header** (see Figure 6.22).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.022.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.22: Property Freeze Column Header
As soon as the Freeze Column Header option is activated the user will
have the option to scroll in the Table with an activated vertical
scrollbar and keep the Table header staying at the top of the Table
display.

Interactive Filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The option to activate the interactive filtering for the Table component
provides the user with a quick and simple way to filter the data shown
in Table at run-time – meaning when the Table is shown as part of your
overall dashboard.

You can activate the interactive filtering for the Table by following
these steps:

1. Navigate to the category **General** and to sub category **General
   Settings** in the Additional Properties sheet.

2. Activate the option Activate Interactive Filtering.

3. As soon as the Filtering has been activated, you will receive an
   additional icon in the column header of the Table (see Figure 6.23).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.023.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.23: Filtering
4. When you execute your dashboard, the Table will provide an
   interactive filter option where the user can click on the Filter icon
   in the column header and either choose a set of members or search for
   particular members and then filter the Table based on the criteria.
   The filtering dialog is closed with a simple click on the Filter icon
   (see Figure 6.24).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.024.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.24: Interactive Filtering Dialog
Column Sizing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Table component provides you with several options to define the
column size for a particular column of your Table. By navigating to the
category Appearance and to the sub category Table Body in the Additional
Properties of Table, you can define a Minimum Row Height and a Minimum
Column Width for your Table and those configured values will be applied
to all the columns (see Figure 6.25).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.025.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.25: Table Formatting
In addition the Table provides the option to resize the columns
interactively by placing the cursor between the two columns and simply
resizing the column to your left with a mouse movement (see Figure
6.26).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.026.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.26: Column Resizing
Table Alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Table provides you with the option to setup Alerts which allow you
to highlight specific cells in the Table based on conditions you can
define. For example, you could highlight all Revenue values in the Table
based on the achievement compared to the Revenue Forecast.

The Table Alerts provide you with the ability to setup an alert based on
three different options:

-  An Alert can be based on a Single Measure, for example comparing the
   measure Profit against a target value.

-  An Alert can be based on a Calculation, where you can setup a
   calculation between two measures and compare the result of the
   calculation against a target value.

-  An Alert can be a set of rules where a measure is being compared
   against a target value.

For the following steps we will use an example with a very simple data
source, showing dimension Product in the Rows and showing three
measures: Profit, Costs, and Net Value (see Figure 6.27).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.027.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.27: Table Example
You can follow these steps to setup an Alert based on a Single Measure:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Place a Table from the VBX Utilities into your new project.

3. Add a data source to your new project. For our example we will assume
   that the data source is similar to what is shown in Figure 6.27.

4. Assign the data source to the Table component.

5. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Conditional
   Formatting in the Additional Properties (see Figure 6.28).

Calculations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Table is also offering the ability to add a custom calculation to
the Table. Calculations can be defined either on a single measure or as
a calculation involving up to two measures.

You can follow these steps to setup a new Calculation for a Table:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Place a Table from the VBX Utilities into your new project.

3. Add a data source to your new project. For our example we will assume
   that the data source is similar to what is shown in Figure 6.109.

4. Assign the data source to the Table component.

5. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Calculation in
   the Additional Properties (see Figure 6.38).

6.  Enter a Name for your new Calculation.

7.  Select the Formula Type. You can choose between Single Measure and
    Two Measures:

    -  In case of a Single Measure you can use the following
       calculations: Rank, Olympic Rank, and Percentage Share of Parent.

    -  In case of Two Measures you can use Add, Subtract, Multiply,
       Divide.

8.  In case you select the option Single Measure, you will have to
    select a measure and a calculation option.

9.  In case you selected the option Two Measures, you will have to
    specify the two measures and the type of calculation.

10. Click Save and the new calculation will be added to the Table.

**Using the Data Utility Tool**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to the charts, the Table component is also offering a Data
Utility tool which allows you to choose from a subset of dimensions that
will be displayed in the Table. Instead of changing the assigned data
source you can choose as part of the Additional Properties of the Table,
which dimensions from the data source you would like to show as part of
the Table.

You can follow these steps to use the Data Utility Tool for a Table:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Place a Table from the VBX Utilities into your new project.

3. Add a new data source to the project. In our example we assume that
   our data source has two dimensions: Product Category and Region.

4. Assign the Data Source to the Table.

5. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility in
   the Additional Properties.

6. Activate the option Enable Data Utility Tool (see Figure 6.42).

7. Here you can now drag and drop from the list of available dimensions,
   those dimensions that you would like to show as part of the Table
   into the Rows / Column area.

8. After you added the dimensions, click Submit.

The Data Utility tool helps you to reduce the need for changing the
initial view and increase the reusability of a single data source
because you can decide which parts of the data source the Table will use
without having to change the data source.

**Simple Mode**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Table component now supports a Simple Mode which can be used to
increase the performance of the Table. In the Simple Mode the following
features cannot be activated: Sorting, Searching, Filtering, and Data
Utility.

You can follow activate the Simple Mode using the following steps:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Place a Table from the VBX Utilities into your new project.

3. Add a new data source to the project.

4. Assign the Data Source to the Table.

5. Navigate to the category **General** and to sub category **General
   Settings** in the Additional Properties.

6. Activate the option Activate Simple Mode (see Figure 6.43).

The Simple Mode especially helps to improve the performance for larger
data volumes.

Figure 6.88: General Properties
6. Activate the option **Enable Search Box.**

7. As soon as the search option is activated, a search text box appears
   above the Table (see Figure 6.87).

8. At run-time whenever you type a search text, the component performs
   an incremental search based on the letters typed and lists only those
   rows that contain a match.

9. The search is not specific to a particular column. For Example, if
   the search text is ‘Administration’, then no matter where the word
   appears in the Table, the row will be filtered for display.

Interactive Sorting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Sort feature in the Advanced Table allows the end users to sort all
the columns of the Table independent of each other. Sorting can either
be ascending or descending. Also, sorting can be applied either on
dimension alphabetically or key figures numerically. The feature also
contains an option to clear all sorting applied previously on the Table.

To enable and configure the sort feature for the Advanced Table you can
follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the category **General** and to sub category **General
   Settings** in the Additional Properties sheet.

2. Activate the option Enable Interactive Sorting (see Figure 6.89).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.071.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.89: Sorting
3. As soon as the sort option is activated, three click options appear
   on the header area of each column of the Table (see Figure 6.90).

a. For the first click on any column header, the **down-arrow** icon
   sorts the rows ascending for the selected column and based on that
   all the column values will get sorted in the ascending order. For our
   example, we have followed the ascending order for the Calendar year
   column and based on that the remaining column values were sorted in
   the ascending order (see Figure 6.90).

b. For the second click on any column header, the **up-arrow** icon
   sorts the rows descending for the selected column and based on that
   all the column values will get sorted in the descending order.

c. For the third click, it clears any sorting that was applied to the
   column.

   component with Dimensions – Item Category, Item Sub category and
   Employee ID and measures - Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order
   Cost. We have activated the Pivot Mode and in run time we have
   swapped the dimensions Item Category and Item Sub category to the row
   groups and applied the function Average for the measure Discount
   Amount, function Count for the Order Amount and function Maximum
   value for the Order Cost. Based on the configuration, we would be
   able to visualize the Table as shown in Figure 6.102.

Table Freezing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Advanced Table component provides the ability to Freeze Top Number
of Rows and Bottom Number of Rows to a desired number of rows, so that
in case you provide the ability for you to use a vertical scrollbar and
you will be able to view the remaining number of rows after freezing the
Top Number of Rows and Bottom Number of Rows. This feature can be
activated and configured by enabling the set of options as given below:

1. Navigate to the category **General** and to sub category **Table
   Freezing** in the Additional Properties sheet.

2. You can set the properties **Freeze Top Number of Rows** and
   **Freeze** **Bottom Number of Rows** to a value (see Figure 6.105)

.. figure:: _static/images/6.087.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.105: Property Table Freezing
As soon as the values for the properties **Freeze Top Number of Rows**
and **Freeze** **Bottom Number of Rows** are provided, you will have the
option to scroll vertical and view the remaining number of rows after
freezing the Top Number of Rows and Bottom Number of Rows to a desired
value. For our example, we have set the property **Freeze Top Number of
Rows** to the value 5 (see Figure 6.106). The top 5 rows have been
freezed and you will be able to scroll vertically downwards to view the
remaining number of rows.

.. _column-sizing-1:

Column Sizing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Advanced Table component provides you with several options to define
the column size for a particular column of your Table. By navigating to
the category Appearance and to the sub category Table Body in the
Additional Properties of Table, you can define a Minimum Row Height and
a Minimum Column Width for your Table and those configured values will
be applied to all the columns (see Figure 6.107).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.089.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.107: Table Formatting
In addition the Table provides the option to resize the columns
interactively by placing the cursor between the two columns and simply
resizing the column to your left with a mouse movement (see Figure
6.108).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.090.jpg

Figure 6.108: Column Resizing
.. _table-alerts-1:

Table Alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Table provides you with the option to setup Alerts which allow you
to highlight specific cells in the Table based on conditions you can
define. For example, you could highlight all Revenue values in the Table
based on the achievement compared to the Revenue Forecast.

The Table Alerts provide you with the ability to setup an alert based on
three different options:

-  An Alert can be based on a Single Measure, for example comparing the
   measure Profit against a target value.

-  An Alert can be based on a Calculation, where you can setup a
   calculation between two measures and compare the result of the
   calculation against a target value.

-  An Alert can be a set of rules where a measure is being compared
   against a target value.

For the following steps we will use an example with a very simple data
source, showing dimension Product in the Rows and showing three
measures: Profit, Costs, and Net Value (see Figure 6.109).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.091.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.109: Table Example
You can follow these steps to setup an Alert based on a Single Measure:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Place a Table from the VBX Utilities into your new project.

3. Add a data source to your new project. For our example we will assume
   that the data source is similar to what is shown in Figure 6.109.

4. Assign the data source to the Table component.

5. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Conditional
   Formatting in the Additional Properties (see Figure 6.110).

Table 6.36:Measure Formatting

13. After you configured the details you can click on Save to apply your
    configurations to the dimension shown in the Table.

**Using the Data Utility Tool**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to the charts, the Table component is also offering a Data
Utility tool which allows you to choose from a subset of dimensions that
will be displayed in the Table. Instead of changing the assigned data
source you can choose as part of the Additional Properties of the Table,
which dimensions from the data source you would like to show as part of
the Table.

You can follow these steps to use the Data Utility Tool for a Table:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Place a Table from the VBX Utilities into your new project.

3. Add a new data source to the project. In our example we assume that
   our data source has two dimensions: Product Category and Region.

4. Assign the Data Source to the Table.

5. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Utility in
   the Additional Properties.

6. Activate the option Enable Data Utility Tool (see Figure 6.124).

7. Here you can now drag and drop from the list of available dimensions,
   those dimensions that you would like to show as part of the Table
   into the Rows / Column area.

8. After you added the dimensions, click Submit.

The Data Utility tool helps you to reduce the need for changing the
initial view and increase the reusability of a single data source
because you can decide which parts of the data source the Table will use
without having to change the data source.

.. _context-menu-options-1:

Context Menu options 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Run Time, the Table component also offers Context Menu options with
the following features (see Figure 6.125).

a. Pin Column: The selected column in the Table will be moved towards
   first column position using Pin Left option and moved towards last
   column position using Pin Right option.

b. Autosize This Column: The selected column in the Table will be
   resized.

c. Autosize All Columns: All the columns in the Table will be resized.

d. Reset Columns: All the columns will be reset to the default position.

e. Tool Panel: The Pivot Mode option will be enabled.

f. Expand All: The Table will be viewed in hierarchical structure
   showing the Parent and Child Nodes.

g. Collapse All: The Table will be viewed in in hierarchical structure
   showing only the Parent Nodes. By clicking the Parent node, it will
   display the child nodes.

XLS Data Source in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio 
-----------------------------------------------------

The XLS Data Source is a custom data source component offered as a part
of the VBX suite which allows the dashboard developers to use local
Microsoft Excel file (XLS) and Google Spreadsheet as data inputs. You
have several options in regards to the storage and location of the file:

-  You can use a local spreadsheet, which means the file needs to be
   available in the local application folder of the SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio application.

-  You can store the file onto your SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform and
   access the file there.

-  You can use a hosted Google Spreadsheet.

Supported File Formats

Currently this component only supports the file format XLS for the
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. The data source should contain at least
one Key Figure. If not, the dimension value is considered as a Key
Figure and would return values as “00”.

How to use the XLS Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following sections we will outline the steps for each of the
options on the storage location of the spreadsheet file and how you can
leverage the data from the spreadsheet as part of your next dashboarding
project.

How to use the Local Spreadsheet option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following steps we will outline how you can use the option to
store the spreadsheet to the local application folder and how you can
then use a locally stored spreadsheet as part of your next dashboarding
project. For our example we will assume that we are using a spreadsheet
file that contains data that is similar to the information shown in
Table 6.42:

+-------------------+---------+------+
| Product Dimension | Revenue | Cost |
+===================+=========+======+
| Product A         | 100     | 50   |
+-------------------+---------+------+
| Product B         | 200     | 100  |
+-------------------+---------+------+
| Product C         | 250     | 120  |
+-------------------+---------+------+
| Product D         | 300     | 50   |
+-------------------+---------+------+
| Product E         | 400     | 100  |
+-------------------+---------+------+

Export to PDF Component
-----------------------

As the name indicates, the Export to PDF Component allows the dashboard
designer to add the ability for you to export the entire dashboard to a
PDF File. The component offers settings related to page orientation,
page size, header, footer, and page numbering.

Export of Large Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PDF Export component allows you to export large Tables (VBX Table
component) with the ability to repeat row and column headers across the
pages. You have two main properties to enable this functionality:

-  By navigating to the category General and to the sub category General
   Settings and to the area Export Settings in the Additional Properties
   of PDF component, you can use the property Full Table Print which
   allows to export the complete Table.

-  By navigating to the category General and to the sub category General
   Settings and to the area Export Settings in the Additional Properties
   of PDF component, you can use the property Enable Server Side PDF
   Export which allows to leverage the VBX Export Service for exporting
   large Tables to improve the performance of the exporting workflow.

How to use the Export to PDF Component option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline the steps required to add the
Export to PDF Component to your dashboard and to offer the ability to
export your dashboard into a PDF File to your users.

You can follow these steps to add the Export to PDF Component to your
dashboard:

1. Start SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer and
   create a new project.

2. Add all the components and data sources you would like to be part of
   your overall dashboard.

3. For our example, the dashboard contains a single chart and a single
   Table.

4. Now add a Export to PDF Component from the VBX Utilities to your
   dashboard (see Figure 6.139).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.117.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.139: PDF Export
5. The Export to PDF Component is a simple button that you can leverage
   to export the dashboard.

6. Select the Export to PDF Component in the Outline of your
   application.

7. Now navigate to the Additional Properties of the Export to PDF
   Component. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please
   select the menu View • Additional Properties to show the Additional
   Properties.

8. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category General
   Settings (see Figure 6.140).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.118.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.140: Additional Properties
9.  In the area Export Settings, you can configure the following items:

    -  PDF Orientation

    -  PDF Format

    -  Document Name for the Export file

    -  Page Margins

    -  Header / Footer Text

    -  Date and Page Numbers can be included into the Export

    -  Option to export Large Tables

10. In addition you have the option to add Comment Boxes that you – at
    the time when exporting the dashboard – can use to provide
    additional comments. These comments will be added to the PDF file
    (see Figure 6.141).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.119.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.141: Comments
11. Scroll down to the area Comments.

12. Enter the values for two Comment boxes by entering the Top and Left
    values for two rows. The Top and Left values are pixels starting
    from the Top left corner of your dashboard.

13. In my example I did add two options to add comments for the chart
    and for the Table (see Figure 6.142).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.120.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.142: Dashboard with PDF Export
14. Now select the meu Application • Execute Locally.

15. You should see your dashboard with the PDF Export button and the
    Commenting options.

16. User can click on the Comment symbol and enter their comments.

17. Click on the Export Button (see Figure 6.143).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.121.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.143: Export Dialog
18. You now has the option to either export the complete dashboard or to
    select specific components from the dashboard.

    -  When exporting the complete dashboard, the complete dashboard
       will be exported onto a single page based on the settings in the
       Additional Properties.

    -  When exporting selected components, these selected components
       will be exported on individual pages in the PDF file.

19. You also has the option to navigate to the Components area of the
    Export dialog and select individual components for the export, as
    well as filtering the list of components based on component type.

Additional Properties of the Export to PDF Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following sections you will find a list of available properties
and a Table with a more detailed description of each of the properties
for the Additional Properties of the Export to PDF Component.

Table 6.46: Scripting Functions

Events for the Export to PDF Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently the Export to PDF Component does not have Scripting Events.

What-If Analyzer
----------------

The What-If-Analyzer component provides the dashboard designer with the
ability to integrate a ”what-if” scenario for you to activate on
individual components. The What-If Analyzer allows you to change values
by either using a percentage based increase or decrease or by changing
the values with an absolute increase or decrease (see Figure 6.144).
Additionally, the What-If Analyzer allows the use of calculated
measures. For every change in values in the component, corresponding
changes can be applied either on all the charts or on specific selected
charts.

The What-if Analyzer provides a simple mode and an advanced mode. In the
simple mode you can select a measure from the underlying data source and
you will then be able to configure either a percentage increase /
decrease for the measure or an absolute increase / decrease.

In the advanced mode you can setup your own parameters and calculations
and the defined parameters can become part of these calculations.

For example, a simple scenario could be to increase / decrease the
measure cost based on a percentage increase / decrease. For example, an
advanced scenario could be to define a parameter “Growth Rate” and to
create a calculation where you multiply your existing revenue numbers
with the Growth Rate and as part of the What If scenario you would then
influence the Growth Rate measure.

Figure 6.144: What If Analyzer
How to create a simple scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps you can see, how you can setup a simple scenario
with the What-If-Analyzer.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a Data Source to your project. For this example we will assume
   that your data source has a measure called Revenue.

3. Add a Column / Bar chart from the VBX Charts to your project.

4. Add the What-If Analyzer component from the Utilities to your
   project.

5. Now assign your data source to the chart and assign your data source
   as well to the What-If Analyzer.

6. Now navigate to the category What-If Scenario and select the sub
   category Scenario in the Additional Properties of the What-If
   Analyzer.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.123.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.145: What If Analyzer
7.  In the List Box Select Measure you can now select the measure
    Revenue from your data source.

8.  You can then decide if you would like to change the value by using
    Percentages or Absolute values.

9.  In the area Set Scenario you can specify the minimum and maximum
    values for the percentage option.

10. After you specified the details, click on Save to add the
    configuration to the list.

11. Now navigate to the Components tab.

12. The previously added Column / Bar chart will be listed and you can
    select the chart, so that it will be impacted by the changes in the
    What-if Analyzer.

13. After you selected the chart you can save the details and execute
    the application.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.124.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.146: What If Analyzer - Runtime
After you executed the application you can use the global What-If panel
(see Figure 6.146) or you can leverage the individual panel for each
chart as shown in Figure 6.147.

Figure 6.147: What If Analyzer – Runtime
How to create an Advanced Scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps you can see, how you can setup an advanced
scenario with the What-If-Analyzer.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a Data Source to your project. For this example we will assume
   that your data source has a measure called Revenue.

3. Add a Column / Bar chart from the VBX Charts to your project.

4. Add the What-If Analyzer from the Utilities to your project.

5. Now assign your data source to the chart and assign your data source
   as well to the What-If Analyzer.

6. Now navigate to the Additional Properties of the category What-If
   Scenario and select the sub category Scenario.

7. Set the property to the Advanced mode of the What-If Analyzer in the
   Additional Properties.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.126.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.148: What If Analyzer
8.  You can – like we did before in the simple mode – define the
    increase / decrease for a simple measure but with the advanced mode
    you also can setup a factor which then can become part of a formula.

9.  Add a new factor by simply typing the factor name in to input field
    for Factor Name. For our example we will use the Factor Name growth.

10. Select one of the two options: Percentage or Absolute.

11. Define the minimum and maximum values.

12. Click Add to add the new Factor to the list.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.127.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.149: Calculation
13. In addition to defining the factor you can now also define a
    calculation. Enter a new Calculation Name.

14. Navigate to the Formula Field and type in “@” to start listing the
    possible measures or factors.

15. Select for example the measure Revenue from the data source by
    typing in @Revenue.

16. Add the “*” to multiply.

17. Type in “@” and you will receive a list of measures and Factors.
    Select the previously created factor from the list.

18. Your complete formula should look similar to @Revenue \* @FACTOR.

19. Click Save.

20. Now navigate to the Components tab.

21. The previously added Column / Bar chart will be listed and you can
    select the chart, so that it will be impacted by the changes in the
    What-if Analyzer.

22. After you selected the chart you can save the details and execute
    the application.

In addition to the measure from the simple scenario, you can now also
set a value for the factor you created and the created calculation will
also be added to the chart as shown in Figure 6.150.

Trend Icon
----------

Trend Icon - Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Trend Icon component allows the dashboard designer to add an icon
with an additional label text to the overall dashboard. In addition, the
Trend Icon provides conditional formatting, so that the dashboard
designer can configure a set of highlighting rules based on static
measures, dynamic measures, or a target value definition (see Figure
6.151).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.129.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.151: Trend Icon
The Trend Icon allows you to select a specific icon from a list of
predefined icons as shown in Figure 6.152.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.130.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.152: Icon List
In addition to selecting the icon and configuring the text that will be
displayed next to the icon, you also have the ability to configure the
Icon Size, Icon Angle, and Icon Color.

Trend Icon – Data Source Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Trend Icon can be used without any data source assignment to display
a particular text or icon, but in case you would like to leverage the
conditional formatting capabilities you will have to assign a data
source to the Trend Icon. The Trend Icon is comparing a single value
against the rules defined as part of the conditional formatting and
therefore the assigned Data Source needs to be a single data cell
defined using the Data Selection property in the Standard Properties.

To define the Data Selection you can follow these steps:

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a new
   project.

2. Add a new Data Source as part of your new project.

3. Add a new Trend Icon from the VBX Utilities are to your new project.

4. Navigate to the Standard Properties of the Trend Icon (see Figure
   6.153). In case the Standard Properties are not shown, please use the
   menu View **•** Properties to activate the display of the
   properties\ **.**

.. figure:: _static/images/6.131.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.153: Trend Icon Standard Properties
5. Assign your Data Source to the property Data Source.

6. Navigate to the property Data Selection.

7. Open the editor with the button on the right hand side and select a
   single value (see Figure 6.154).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.132.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.154: Data Selection
8. Confirm the Data Selection and click OK.

You now assigned a single data value to the Trend Icon and you can now
define the conditional formatting for the Trend Icon and define rules
that will be compared against the assigned single value.

How to use the Trend Icon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the next section we will outline how you can setup a Trend Icon,
assign the data source, and setup a set of rules for the conditional
formatting. For the following steps we will assume that we have a data
source with a single dimension in the Rows and a set of three measures
shown in the columns (see Figure 6.155).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.133.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.155: Sample Dataset
You can follow the steps below to configure a Trend Icon:

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a new
   project.

2. Add a new Data Source as part of your new project.

3. Add a new Trend Icon from the VBX Utilities are to your new project.

4. Navigate to the Standard Properties of the Trend Icon (see Figure
   6.153). In case the Standard Properties are not shown, please use the
   menu View **•** Properties to activate the display of the
   properties\ **.**

5. Assign your Data Source to the property Data Source.

6. Navigate to the property Data Selection.

7. Use the Data Selection property to assign a single value to the Trend
   Icon. In our example we will assign the Total value of our measure
   Cost to the Trend Icon.

8. Now select the Trend Icon.

9. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Trend Icon (see Figure
   6.156). In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use
   the menu View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of
   the properties\ **.**

.. figure:: _static/images/6.134.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.156: Appearance Category
10. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category General
    Settings and to the area General in the Additional Properties. You
    can configure the Text that will be displayed next to the Trend Icon
    and you can configure the Default Icon settings, such as the Default
    Icon, Default Size, Default Color, and the Default Angle.

11. For our example we will configure the following values:

    -  Text Position: Right

    -  Trend Icon Text: Product Cost

    -  Default Icon: Arrow Up

    -  Default Size: 25

    -  Default Color: Red

    -  Default Angle: 0 degree

12. Click Update.

13. Now navigate to the Enable Google Font property (see Figure 6.157).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.135.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.157: Appearance Category
14. In the category Appearance you have the ability to configure the
    font details for the Trend Icon Text.

15. For our example we will configure the following options:

    -  Enable the Google Font

    -  Select the Google Font Roboto

    -  Font Style: Bold

    -  Font Color: Black

    -  Font Size: 14

16. Your Trend Icon should look similar to Figure 6.158:

.. figure:: _static/images/6.136.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.158: Trend Icon
17. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Conditional
    Formatting in the Additional Properties.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.137.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.159: Category Data
18. In the sub category Conditional Formatting you can setup a set of
    rules allowing you to define conditional formatting for the Trend
    Icon.

In the next set of steps we will outline the different options on
defining Alerts for the Trend Icon. The Trend Icon supports three types
of Alerts: Single Measure, Measure Calculation, and Target Value. We
will start with an example for the Single Measure Type.

To define an Alert Type Single Measure you can follow these steps:

1. In the sub category Conditional Formatting, click on Create Rule.

2. Enter a Rule Name.

3. Select the Rule Type Single Measure (see Figure 6.160).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.138.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.160: Rule Type Single Measure
4. When choosing the rule type Single Measure, you can compare the
   assigned value of the Trend Icon against the value of a single cell
   selection.

5. Select a Comparison Operator. The available operators are:

-  Greater than

-  Greater than or Equal to

-  Lesser than

-  Lesser than or Equal to

-  Equal

-  Between

6.  Choose a Comparison Value Type. You can choose between a Static and
    a Dynamic comparison value.

7.  When selecting the option Static for the Comparison Value Type, you
    can manually enter a Comparison Value.

8.  When selecting the option Dynamic for the Comparison Value Type, you
    can select a cell value from the assigned data source as Comparison
    Value.

9.  For our example we will use the following options:

    -  Comparison Operator: Less Than

    -  Comparison Value Type: Dynamic

    -  Comparison Value: We use the Data Selection to select the Total
       Value for the Revenue.

10. You can then configure the options Alert Icon, Icon angle, Icon
    Size, and Icon Color specifically for this rule.

11. For our example we set the following options:

    -  Alert Icon: Arrow-down

    -  Icon Angle: 0 degree

    -  Icon Size: 25

    -  Icon Color: Green

12. Click Save to add the new rule to the list of Alert rules.

In this scenario we defined an Alert Rule comparing the Total Cost with
the Total Revenue and showing a green arrow up when the Cost is less
than the Revenue.

To define an Alert Type Measure Calculation you can follow these steps:

1. In the sub category Conditional Formatting, click on Create Rule.

2. Enter a Rule Name.

3. Select the Rule Type Measure Calculation (see Figure 6.161).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.139.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.161: Rule Type Measure Calculation
4. On choosing the Rule Type Measure Calculation, the assigned value of
   the Trend Icon is compared to the result of the calculation of two
   measures.

5. Select a Comparison Operator. The available operators are:

-  Greater than

-  Greater than or Equal to

-  Lesser than

-  Lesser than or Equal to

-  Equal

6.  You can assign cell values from the underlying data source to the
    Comparison Value 1 and Comparison Value 2.

7.  Select an Operator for the measure calculation. The available
    operators are :

    -  Add

    -  Subtract

    -  Multiply

    -  Divide

8.  You can configure the Alert Icon, Angle, Size, and Color as part of
    the Alert Rule and those settings will then overwrite the default
    behavior when the conditions of the rule are met.

9.  For our example we will use the following settings:

    -  Comparison Operator: Greater Than

    -  Comparison Value 1: We use the Data Selection to select the Total
       Value for the Revenue.

    -  Operator: Subtract

    -  Comparison Value 2: We use the Data Selection to select the Total
       Value for the Profit.

    -  Alert Icon: Arrow-down

    -  Icon Angle: 0 degree

    -  Icon Size: 25

    -  Icon Color: Red

10. Once the Alert rule is created, click on Save.

In this scenario we defined an Alert Rule comparing the Total Cost with
the result of subtracting the Total Profit from the Total Revenue.

To define an Alert Type Target Value you can follow these steps:

1. In the sub category Conditional Formatting, click on Add Rule.

2. Enter a Rule Name.

3. Select the Rule Type as Target Value (see Figure 6.162).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.140.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.162: Rule Type Target Value
4. You can choose a Static or Dynamic Comparison Value Type. In case of
   a Static value you can enter manually a Comparison Value. In case of
   a Dynamic option, you can select a data cell from the assigned data
   source.

5. Click on the Create button to create a new rule (see Figure 6.163).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.141.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.163: Alert Rules
6. You can now enter the From and To values, as well as configure the
   Icon Color, Icon type, Icon Size, and Icon Angle for each rule.

7. For our example we are defining the following details:

   -  Comparison Value Type: Dynamic

   -  Comparison Value: We use the Data Selection to select the Total
      Value for the Revenue.

8. We define two rules highlighting values from 0 to 50% with a red icon
   and values from 51 to 90% with an orange icon (see Figure 6.164).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.142.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.164: Alert Rules
9. Click Save.

In this scenario we defined a set of rules which will display a green
icon for a Cost value in the range of 0 to 50% when compared with the
Revenue, and an orange icon when the Cost value is in the range of 51 to
90%.

The PPT Export component allows you to add the option to export your
complete dashboard or parts of your dashboard into a Microsoft

Starting with release 1.68, the PPT Export will include all content that
is set to be visible in the dashboard, even when the content might not
be visible in the actual browser window and might require scrollbars in
the browser window to be seen.

    dashboard or you can export the complete dashboard.

    -  Export Selected Components: In this scenario each selected
       component will be exported to a single slide in the Microsoft
       PowerPoint file.

    -  Export Complete Dashboard: In this scenario the complete
       dashboard will be exported to a single slide in the Microsoft
       PowerPoint file.

    components will be exported and you will receive the exported file
    to your client system.

How to setup Templates for the Export to PPT Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Export to PPT Component also allows the use of templates. A template
is basically a Microsoft PowerPoint file where you specify the size and
location of each component which should be exported to the Microsoft
PowerPoint file. In the following steps we will show how you can setup a
Template for the Export Component and how you can integrate the template
into the dashboard.

PowerPoint Template File Format

Please note, that the supported file format for using Microsoft
PowerPoint template is PPTX only.

For our example we assume that our final dashboard will have three
components

-  A Column Chart with the technical name COLUMNCHART1

-  A Line Chart with the technical name LINECHART1

-  A Table with the technical name TABLE1

The technical name mentioned above refers to the technical name of the
component in the SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
project shown in the Standard Properties of each component. You can use
the technical name of the individual components and place a Text Box
into your Microsoft PowerPoint template file to reference the individual
components and to decide where the items are placed.

You can follow the steps below to setup the PPT Template file:

1. Start Microsoft PowerPoint.

2. Create a new PowerPoint file with two slides.

3. Navigate to the first slide.

4. Insert a Text Box onto the first slide.

5. Size the first Text Box to the size that you would like to use for
   the Column Chart.

6. Use a right-click on the Text Box and select the menu Format Shape.

7. Navigate to the Text Box size properties and activate the option Do
   not Autofit (see Figure 6.167).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.145.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.167: Format Shape
8.  Now enter the text COLUMNCHART1 into the Text Box.

9.  Repeat the steps and create a Text Box with the text LINECHART1 on
    the first slide of the presentation.

10. Now navigate to the second slide

11. Create a Text Box with the text TABLE1.

12. Save the presentation to your computer.

13. Close Microsoft PowerPoint.

14. Navigate back to SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer project.

15. Select the Export to PPT Component

16. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Export to PPT
    Component. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please
    use the menu View **•** Additional Properties to activate the
    display of the properties\ **.**

17. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category General
    Settings and to the area Export Settings in the Additional
    Properties (see Figure 6.165).

18. Click on Select PPT Template for the property Upload PPT Template
    (see Figure 6.168).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.146.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.168: Upload PPT Template
19. A browser window will get started and you can select the file we
    created previously.

20. After you selected the file click Upload in the Additional
    Properties.

21. You should receive a message about the successful upload (see Figure
    6.169).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.147.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.169: Successful Upload
22. Activate the option Enable PPTX Templates.

23. Enter the file name from your template into the property PPTX
    Template File Name.

24. Use the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

25. Click on your Export Button.

26. The dashboard is being exported and you should receive the exported
    file based on the template you configured.

In addition to referencing the technical names of the individual
components you can also reference the placeholders shown in the sub
category Placeholder Text of the Additional Properties of the Export to
PPT Component as part of your template file. In case of the placeholders
the text entered in the Additional Properties will then be placed into
the exported file.

Export to PPT Workflow

In case you are using a Microsoft PowerPoint Template file as part of
the Export to PPT configuration, you will not be asked anymore if the
complete dashboard or only selected components are supposed to be
exported but instead the template file will be used and all components
that match the template file will be exported.

How to use the placeholders 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the sub category Placeholder Text you have up to nine placeholders,
which you can also include into the template filed. Placeholders are
referenced using the {} brackets. For example you could use {Text
Placeholder 1} as part of your Template file and when the dashboard is
being exported, the text entered for Text Placeholder 1 would then
replace the placeholder in the exported file.

In addition to the Text Placeholder listed in the General category, you
can also use the placeholder {Date} to include the actual date as part
of the exported file. You can use the property Date Format in the
category General to specify the format for the date value. Table 6.53
shows the available options to define the date format.

+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Value Option | Description                               |
+==============+===========================================+
| d            | Single digit day value.                   |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| dd           | Double digit day value.                   |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| D            | Short day name. For example Mon, Tue, Wed |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| DD           | Full day name.                            |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| m            | Numeric single digit month value.         |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| mm           | Numeric double digit month value.         |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| M            | Short month name, for example Jan, Feb.   |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| MM           | Full month name.                          |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| yy           | Double digit year value.                  |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+
| yyyy         | Four digit year value.                    |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------+

Responsive UI Container
-----------------------

The Responsive UI Container allows the dashboard designer to setup a
complete dashboards or individual parts of a dashboard as part of the
Responsive UI Container and in that way these components will adapt its
layout to screen resolution and screen orientation.

Responsive UI Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Responsive UI component provides you with a container component that
will adjust the size of the components as well as the placement of the
components based on screen size and screen orientation. You have the
option to decide how many child container the Responsive UI Container
will use and you can assign your components to these child containers.
The actual layout and look and feel depends on the order of the
components inside the child container.

For example, you could use a Responsive UI Container with only one child
container using the complete space showing a total of four tiles (see
Figure 6.174).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.152.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.174: Responsive UI Sample 1
In case you would execute such a dashboard and change the size or change
the orientation of the device, the layout will automatically adjust.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.153.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.175: Responsive UI Sample 2
Figure 6.175 showing the adjusted layout based on a smaller screen size
where then one of the tiles is automatically being moved into a second
row.

In addition the Responsive UI Container is also providing you with the
option to split the container into several child container, which
provides you with the ability to separate components. Each child
container and all elements assigned to the child container will react in
a responsive way, but the child container itself will not react in a
responsive manner globally.

For example, if we setup a Responsive UI Container with two child
container (see Figure 6.176) and place the four tiles in a way that two
tiles are in each of the child containers, then the two tiles in each
container will become responsive.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.154.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.176: Responsive UI with Child Container
Figure 6.176 shows the Responsive UI Container with two child containers
of equal size and with two tile components in each of the child
containers. Now running such a dashboard with such configured child
containers means, that content in each of the child containers does
become responsive, but that the child containers towards each other do
not become responsive.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.155.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.177: Responsive UI with Child Container
Figure 6.177 shows the Responsive UI Container with the two child
container on a narrower screen resolution. AS the figure shows, the KPI
Tiles inside each of the child container are reacting in a responsive
way and instead of next to each other the KPI Tiles are shown below each
other, but the two child container are not reacting in a responsive way
globally.

By using the concept of the Child Container you have the option to
decide if you would like to have your complete dashboard acting in a
responsive fashion or if you would like to separate parts of the
dashboard and place specific elements separate from each other. In case
you would like to have the complete dashboard acting in a responsive
fashion, then you would only use one child container. In case you prefer
the option to separate specific elements, then you would create multiple
child container and place components into multiple child container.

In addition the Responsive UI Container allows you to setup multiple
profiles, which gives you the option to setup a different configuration
and a different setup of child containers per profile.

Multiple Screen Support for Responsive UI 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of Release 2.3, a new option has been included in the Responsive
UI component where you can now use multiple screen designs inside SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer. With the help of an
Export Service, it provides the option to truly design the dashboard on
how you would like it to appear across multiple screens on an Executive
Dashboard.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the
settings for the Multiple Screen option in Responsive UI.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a Responsive UI Container from the VBX Utilities to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

3. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Responsive UI Component.
   In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   properties.

4. Navigate to the category Adaptive Layout. For our example, four
   different panels have been created in the Desktop Layout of the
   Responsive UI. Four Data Sources have been assigned to the Project
   (see Figure 6.178).

.. figure:: _static/images/multi1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.178: Layout
5. Based on the above layout you will be able to view the Responsive UI
   as shown below.

.. figure:: _static/images/multi8.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.179: Responsive UI with four panels
6. In the category Adaptive Layout of the Additional Properties for the
   Responsive UI panel, enable the property Enable Multi screen and
   provide the Server URL details for Export Service (see Figure 6.180).

.. figure:: _static/images/multi2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.180: Category Adaptive Layout
7. Through the Multiscreen option and the Export Service options you
   will be able to visualize the four different panels having different
   charts (see Figure 6.179) into four different individual screens with
   its assigned chart in a single Browser session by providing the
   inputs as Screen 1 based on your choice (see Figure 6.181)

.. figure:: _static/images/multi3.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.181: Screen Number
8. Also you can provide the parameter as “&ScreenNumber=1” at the end of
   the URL session based on your choice (see Figure 6.182).

.. figure:: _static/images/multi4.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.182: URL
9. Based on your selected parameter, you will be able to view the screen
   1 as shown below.

.. figure:: _static/images/multiscreen1display.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.183: Source Screen 1
10. If you need to pass a message from Source Screen 1 to Target Screen
    2 then you need to have an Interface component in the form of
    Button” or “HTML Box” to carry out the triggering at Target Screen
    2. For our example, we are passing a message from Source Screen 1 to
    Target Screens 2 and 4 through Button Interfaces. The sample
    scripting part done for the On Select Event for Source Screen 1 is
    shown below.

.. figure:: _static/images/multi5.jpg

Hide / Show option to show specific elements of the Advanced KPI Tile in Responsive UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hide/Show options are available for the usage of the Advanced KPI Tile
in combination with the Responsive UI container that allows you to hide
/ show the specific elements of the Advanced KPI Tile based on specific
profiles of the Responsive UI.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the
settings that allows you to hide / show the specific elements of the
Advanced KPI Tile based on specific profiles of the Responsive UI.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a Advanced KPI Tile from the VBX Utilities to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

3. Now add a Responsive UI Container from the VBX Utilities area. The
   Responsive UI Container will come with a set of 4 child container.
   For our example, the configuration is done for the first child
   container.

4. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Responsive UI Component.
   In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   properties.

Mobile Preview Mode 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release 1.68, the Responsive UI component now provides you
with an option to view the dashboard in a live mobile preview and design
the dashboard for the mobile device with a live preview directly in SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio or SAP Lumira Designer. You can activate
the Mobile Preview option as part of the Additional Properties (see
Figure 6.200) as part of category Adaptive Layout.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.167.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.200: Mobile Preview
After enabling the option in the Additional Properties, you can click on
Mobile Preview and is presented with the live mobile design option (see
Figure 6.201).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.168.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.201: Live Mobile Design
Here you are presented with the different Layouts – in our example we
have one Layout called desktop – and all the available components. You
can now select between different devices and different screen
orientation and simply add the components from the dashboard to the
device area on the left hand side (see Figure 6.202).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.169.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.202: Mobile Design
Each of the components place as part of the mobile design can also be
moved and resized on the mobile device screen. After placing all
components, you can click Finish and the design will then be
automatically created as part of the Responsive UI component.

Panel Design Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The option Enable Panel Design Mode as part of the Additional Properties
can be enabled, so that you have the ability inside each of the panels
of the overall layout to leverage all margin settings from each
component in relative position to each of the panels (see Figure 6.203).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.170.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.203: Panel Design Mode
Responsive Panels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release 1.68, the Responsive UI component also provides
the ability to enable Responsive Panels (see Figure 6.203). In case you
activate the option Responsive Panels, then all panels as part of the
Responsive UI layouts, will react in a responsive way and flow as part
of the overall layout and not stay static in their initial positions.

Chart Properties per Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release 1.68, you has now the ability to overwrite Chart
properties as part of the Layout configuration of the Responsive UI. Per
layout, you can configure, if all charts should use the already
configured options for the properties, or if you would like to overwrite
the behavior and set different options, so that the charts will behave
slightly different for a specific layout (see Figure 6.204).

For example, you could configure the legend of the charts to be
displayed below the charts when viewed on a smartphone, instead of being
placed on the right hand side when being viewed on a laptop.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.171.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.204: Chart Properties
Profile Mapping 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with release VBX 1.68, you also have now the ability to
leverage a list of mobile devices as a template for configuring the
Responsive UI profiles (see Figure 6.205).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.172.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.205: Profile Mapping
You have the option to Enable Device Selection and then configure a list
of devices. The selected devices will then be used to calculate the
Width and Height ranges for the profile.

How to use the Responsive UI – Scenario 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline how you can use the Responsive
UI. In this scenario we are going to setup a Responsive UI Container
with a set of KPI Tiles and ensure that our dashboard will adapt to the
screen resolution as well as the screen orientation. For this example we
will just use static information for the KPI Tiles as the purpose of the
following steps is to outline the main steps for the Responsive UI.

You can follow the steps below to add the setup your first Responsive UI
Container:

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a new
   project.

2. Add a total of four KPI Tiles from the VBX Utilities area.

3. Now add a Responsive UI Container from the VBX Utilities area (see
   Figure 6.206).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.173.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.206: Responsive UI Container
4. By default the Responsive UI Container will come with a set of 4
   child container.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Responsive UI Component.
   In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   properties\ **.**

6. Navigate to the category Adaptive Layout (see Figure 6.207).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.174.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.207: Category Adaptive Layout 
7. In the category Adaptive Layout you can configure a set of different
   layouts and per layout you can setup a number of child containers as
   well as which components are assigned to which child containers.

8. For our first example remove all panels with the exception of Panel 1
   by using the Delete button. Your Layout Design properties should look
   similar to Figure 6.208.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.175.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.208: Layout Design
9.  Now enter the value 100% for the property Height and for the
    property Width for Panel 1. By using the value 100% you are
    configuring Panel 1 to use 100% on Height and Width of the overall
    Responsive UI Container.

10. Now click on the option Select components here to open the list of
    available components (see Figure 6.209).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.176.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.209: Layout Design
11. Add all four KPI Tiles from our example to Panel 1. Your Layout
    Design should look similar to Figure 6.210.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.177.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.210: Layout Design
12. Navigate to the property Adaptive Profiles and edit the Desktop
    profile.

13. Now select the layout for the property Selected Layout, under which
    panels the KPI tiles were added.

In this example you create a simple dashboard containing of four KPI
Tiles with a single Responsive UI Container and you assigned all four
KPI Tiles to a single child container inside the Responsive UI
Container. In this scenario all four KPI Tiles will react in a
responsive manner towards each other and will adjust based on the screen
size and screen orientation.

14. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

15. Your initial screen – depending on screen size – should look similar
    to Figure 6.211.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.178.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.211: Responsive Dashboard
16. When now resizing the browser window, the KPI Tiles will adopt and
    your screen should look similar to Figure 6.212.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.179.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.212: Responsive Dashboard
17. And with even further resizing the browser window, the KPI Tiles
    will adjust even more (see Figure 6.213).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.180.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.213: Responsive Dashboard
18. Depending on your configuration, the container will also provide
    scrollbars.

In this short example we placed four KPI Tiles into a single child
container of a Responsive UI Container. In our example, all four KPI
Tiles will react in a responsive way towards each other.

How to use the Responsive UI – Scenario 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In our second example we will use also the four KPI Tiles, but this time
we will use a Responsive UI with multiple child containers so that you
can see the difference in behavior.

You can follow the steps below to setup the Responsive UI Container:

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a new
   project.

2. Add a total of four KPI Tiles from the VBX Utilities area.

3. Now add a Responsive UI Container from the VBX Utilities area.

4. By default the Responsive UI Container will come with a set of 4
   child container.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Responsive UI Component.
   In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   properties\ **.**

6. Navigate to the category Adaptive Layout.

7. For our example remove all panels with the exception of Panel 1 and
   Panel 2 by using the Delete button. Your Layout Design properties
   should look similar to Figure 6.224.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.181.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.214: Layout Design
8.  Now enter the value 50% for the property Height and 100% for the
    property Width for Panel 1 and for Panel 2. By using these values
    you are splitting the overall size of the Responsive UI in a
    horizontal way equally between Panel 1 and Panel 2.

9.  Now click on the option Select components here to open the list of
    available components.

10. Add KPI Tile 1 and KPI Tile 2 to Panel 1.

11. Add KPI Tile 3 and KPI Tile 4 to Panel 2.

12. Your Layout Design should look similar to Figure 6.215.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.182.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.215: Layout Design
13. Navigate to the property Adaptive Profiles and edit the Desktop
    profile.

14. Now select the layout for the property Selected Layout, under which
    panels the KPI tiles were added.

In this example you create a simple dashboard containing of four KPI
Tiles with Responsive UI Container that contains two child container,
which split the Responsive UI Container horizontally.

We assigned KPI Tile 1 and KPI Tile 2 to the upper child container and
we assigned KPI Tile 3 and KPI Tile 4 to the lower child container. In
this scenario KPI Tile 1 and KPI Tile 2 will react responsive and KPI
Tile 3 and KPI Tile 4 will react responsive, but the child container
will not react responsive towards each other.

15. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

16. Your initial screen – depending on screen size – should look similar
    to Figure 6.216.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.183.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.216: Responsive Dashboard
17. When now resizing the browser window, the KPI Tiles 1 & 2 as well as
    3 &4 will adopt as part of the child container and your screen
    should look similar to Figure 6.217.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.184.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.217: Responsive Dashboard with Child Container
As you can see the assigned tiles in each child container will adjust
based on the screen size and screen orientation, but the child container
itself will not adjust towards each other. In our example KPI Tile 1 & 2
will adjust and based on the more narrow screen size will be shown below
each other and in the lower part of the screen the same behavior will be
shown for KPI Tile 3 & 4.

How to use Profiles as part of the Responsive UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the Responsive UI Container it is possible to setup different
profiles and assign these profiles to different screen resolutions. In
that way you can define a different layout for different devices. This
option is in addition to the standard behavior of the Responsive UI when
it comes to adopting based on screen size and screen orientation and
provides you with additional flexibility.

In our example we will setup a layout for a desktop based screen
resolution and a different layout for a mobile based screen resolution.
We will assume that we have a dashboard that consists of a total of four
buttons as well as two charts. For the following steps we will simply
use the components without data source assignment and outline the steps
on how you would setup the different profiles and assign the profiles to
different screen resolutions.

Our dashboard contains the following components:

-  BUTTON_1

-  BUTTON_2

-  BUTTON_3

-  BUTTON_4

-  CHART_1

-  CHART_2

For our example we will setup two different profiles, one profile that
will be used on a mobile device and one profile that will be used for
the desktops / browser based access. Figure 6.218 and Figure 6.219 show
the two profiles we will setup in the next couple of steps.

Figure 6.219: Mobile Profile
For the following steps we assume that you have a SAP BusinessObjects
Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project which contains the four
buttons and the two charts already.

You can follow the steps below to setup the Responsive UI Container:

1. Add a Responsive UI Container to your project.

2. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Responsive UI Component.
   In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   properties\ **.**

3. Navigate to the category Adaptive Layout.

4. For our example we need a total of three panels. Remove all panels
   with the exception of Panel 1, Panel 2, and Panel 3.

5. The Layout Design should look similar to Figure 6.220.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.187.jpg

17. In the category Adaptive Layout click now on the “+” sign next to
    the layout name Desktop.

18. Enter Mobile Layout as the name for the newly created layout.

19. Set the following values for Panel 1:

    -  Height 10%

    -  Width 100%

20. Set the following values for Panel 2:

    -  Height 90%

    -  Width 50%

21. Set the following values for Panel 3:

    -  Height 90%

    -  Width 50%

22. Now click on the option Add component here for Panel 1 to open the
    list of available components.

23. Add all four buttons to Panel 1.

24. Now click on the option Add component here for Panel 2 to open the
    list of available components.

25. Add the first chart to Panel 2.

26. Now click on the option Add component here for Panel 3 to open the

Figure 6.223: Profile Mapping
30. In the Profile Mapping you can now assign the previously created
    Layouts to ranges of screen resolutions as well as Desktop or Mobile
    devices.

31. The Profile Mapping comes with three default rules defined and you
    can assign your layouts to it.

32. For our example use the third Rule with the Name Desktop and make
    sure the values are set as shown below:

+-------------------+-------------+
| Property          | Value       |
+===================+=============+
| Profile Name      | Desktop     |
+-------------------+-------------+
| Selected Layout   | Desktop     |
+-------------------+-------------+
| Font Scale (in %) | 100         |
+-------------------+-------------+
| Device Type       | Desktop     |
+-------------------+-------------+
| Height            | 800 to 1500 |
+-------------------+-------------+
| Width             | 640 to 1500 |
+-------------------+-------------+

Table 6.63: Profile Mapping – Rule 1

33. For our second rule use the existing rule with the Name Tablet and
    ensure the values are set as shown below:

+-------------------+---------------+
| Property          | Value         |
+===================+===============+
| Profile Name      | Tablet        |
+-------------------+---------------+
| Selected Layout   | Mobile Layout |
+-------------------+---------------+
| Font Scale (in %) | 100           |
+-------------------+---------------+
| Device Type       | Mobile        |
+-------------------+---------------+
| Height            | 1200 to 1600  |
+-------------------+---------------+
| Width             | 1900 to 2200  |
+-------------------+---------------+

Table 6.64: Profile Mapping – Rule 2

34. Remove the third rule with the Name Smartphone.

35. We did now setup two rules assigning our previously configured
    Profiles to specific resolution ranges as well as the fact that we
    assigned specific profiles either to a Desktop or Mobile based
    access.

36. Configure the Default Profile with the Desktop Profile.

37. Save all your changes in the dashboard.

38. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

39. You should now see the dashboard being displayed with the Desktop
    profile and when accessing it using a mobile device, the Mobile
    Profile should be used.

Profiles and Matching Devices

Each Rule shown in the category Adaptive Profile of the Additional
Properties is also shown a light bulb icon in the top right corner (see
Figure 6.223) and you can click on the icon to see a list of matching
devices for the rule that you configured.

Advanced KPI Tile
-----------------

The Advanced KPI Tile allows you to create your own structure for an
overall KPI Tile and to choose from a variety of container template to
define the content of the KPI Tile.

Advanced KPI Tile – Container Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Advanced KPI Tile is providing you with a set of container
templates, which you can use to define the content of the tile
structure. The following are the type of container templates available:

-  | Header
   | The container template Header allows you to use a Title, Subtitle,
     and an Icon. The container template Header does not include any
     measure values.

-  | Footer
   | The container template Footer allows you to use a Footer,
     Subfooter, and a KPI value.

-  | KPI
   | The container template KPI allows you to use a KPI value and a
     Footer text.

-  | Sparkline Chart
   | The container template Sparkline Chart allows you to choose one
     sparkline chart type from the list of available charts. Currently
     the available chart types are: Column, Area, Line, Bar, Spline,
     Bullet, Win/Loss.

-  | Icon
   | The container template Icon allows you to visualize a Icon as part
     of the overall KPI Tile. The Icon could be static or the Icon could
     have data assigned to it.

Data Source Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In regards to the data source requirements for the Advanced KPI Tile,
the requirements vary between the different container templates. Each
container template can point to different parts of the data source, but
a Advanced KPI Tile overall can only be assigned to a single data source
at this point (Release VBX 1.50).

The following are the data source requirements for the container
templates:

-  | Header
   | The Header container does not provide an option to visualize
     measure values directly, but does have the ability to point to
     measure names or dimension members and retrieve those dynamically.

-  | Footer
   | The Footer container does provide the ability to point to measure
     names and dimension members dynamically as well as the option to
     display the value of a KPI. The value of the KPI is based on a cell
     selection from the overall assigned data source.

-  | KPI
   | The KPI container provides you with the option to display the value
     of either a cell selection or a calculation. In case of a
     calculation you can choose two cells from the overall assigned data
     source as basis for the calculation.

-  | Sparkline Chart
   | The Sparkline Container allows you to define a data selection for
     the chart. This data selection could be a single cell or a range of
     cells

-  | Icon
   | The Icon container allows you to assign a cell selection to the
     icon.

How to use the Advanced KPI Tile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we will outline the steps to setup your first Advanced
KPI Tile. We will setup a KPI Tile that shows the actual revenue for
this month, shows an indication of the revenue of this month compared to
the month of last year, shows a trend of the last 12 months of revenue,
and shows an indication of our current annual revenue compared to the
revenue from last year.

In regards to our sample data set, we will use a data set that looks
similar to the data shown below.

Pictogram
---------

The Pictogram component provides you with similar functionality like the
Waffle Chart, but the Pictogram gives you the additional functionality
to configure the number of rows and columns that should be displayed
whereas a Waffle Chart will always be a 10 x 10 matrix.

Figure 6.274: Pictogram
Data Source Requirements for a Pictogram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimum data source requirement for a Pictogram is a data source
with at least two cell values, so that one cell selection would
represent the value and the second value would represent the maximum
value. In addition, the Pictogram can also leverage dimensions in the
rows for the Dimension Stacking feature.

How to use a Pictogram 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Pictogram
as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project. You can follow the steps below to configure the
Pictogram:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows one measure - Sales Amount and a second measure
   Forecast Amount - and one dimension Product.

3. Add a Pictogram from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Pictogram.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Pictogram.

6. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
   View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   Additional Properties.

7. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category General
   Settings in the Additional Properties of the Pictogram where you can
   configure the Pictogram type (see Figure 6.275).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.222.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.275: Category General
8.  For our example, set the property No of Rows to the value 10.

9.  Set the property No of Columns to the value 15.

10. You have the option to choose between Percentage or Number for the
    property Pictogram Type. Percentage will represent the values as
    actual percentages, even when the assigned values are of numeric
    nature. Number will represent the assigned values as numeric values.
    For our example, you can set the property Pictogram Type to the
    option Percentage.

11. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series
    (see Figure 6.276) in the Additional Properties for the Pictogram.
    Here you can configure the Pictogram to use static data, dynamic
    data, and a calculation for two different dynamic values of the
    Measures. For our example, we will proceed with the calculation
    using two different dynamic data values.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.223.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.276: Category Data 
12. Ensure the option Enable Static Data is disabled.

13. Navigate to the area Calculation.

14. Enable the option Enable Calculation.

15. Use the button on the right hand side to open the Data Selection for
    Measure 1 (see Figure 6.277).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.234.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.277: Data Selection
16. Select the cell for the first value.

17. Click OK.

18. Use the button on the right hand side to open the Data Selection for
    Measure 2.

19. Select the cell for the second value.

20. Click OK.

21. Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Data
    Label in the Additional Properties (see Figure 6.278).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.225.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.278: Plot Options
22. Activate the option Enable Custom Text.

23. Navigate to the Custom Text field.

24. You have two custom texts that you can include:

    -  {value}: Representing the actual value.

    -  {max}: representing the Maximum value

25. Enter the following Custom Text: {value} of {max}.

26. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.

27. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

28. Your Pictogram should now look similar to Figure 6.279

.. figure:: _static/images/6.226.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.279: Pictogram
In addition to displaying the percentage values or the actual numbers,
the Pictogram also has the option to use a feature called Dimension
stacking. In the next couple of steps we will create a new Pictogram
using the Dimension Stacking features.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source shows one measure - Profit and a second measure Cost
   - and one dimension Product.

3. Add a Pictogram from the VBX Charts to your SAP BusinessObjects
   Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data Series and
   to the area Dimension Stacking in the Additional Properties.

5. Ensure the option Enable Static Data is disabled.

6. Activate the property Enable Dimension Stacking (see Figure 6.280).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.227.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.280: Dimension Stacking
7.  Activate the property Enable Dimension Stacking (see Figure 6.280).

8.  Set the property Select Measure to the option Profit.

9.  You can now choose for each of the dimension members – in our
    example dimension Product – a color and a symbol and the Pictogram
    will then visualize the percentage share using the symbol and color
    for each member.

10. Set the color for each dimension member.

11. Click on the default selected icon and choose an icon for each
    dimension member.

12. Navigate to the menu Application **•** Save.

13. Select the menu Application **•** Execute Locally.

14. Your Pictogram should now look similar to Figure 6.281.

Additional Properties of the Pictogram 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Properties
for all charts. In this section we will outline the Additional
Properties that are specific to the Pictogram.

Scripting Functions for the Pictogram 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All supported scripting functions for the Pictogram are listed as part
of the common scripting functions for charts listed in section 4.6.

Web Service as Data Source
--------------------------

The new option to use a Web Service as a data source provides you with
the option to use SOAP based web services as a data source and to use a
BI Web Services based on a Web Intelligence report as a data source with
SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer. In case of a Web
Intelligence report, the new Web Service data source option supports the
ability to use a BI Web Service that is based on Tables in the Web
Intelligence report.

Export Service

The Web Service as a Data Source option requires the Export Service to
be installed and running prior to its usage. You will be configuring a
Service URL as part of the Export Service installation. The generated
URL from the Export Service will be the input for the Service URL
properties in the Server Configuration in Category General of the
Additional Properties.

In the following steps, we will first outline the steps on how to create
a Web Intelligence report and a BI Web Service based on this report.
After those steps we will then use the BI Web Service in SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

Creation of Web Intelligence Report and Web Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps show how you can create a report in Web Intelligence
and then create a BI Web Service based on this report, so that you can
use the BI Web Service in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer. For our example we will use a BEx Query as data source with
three dimensions and two measures.

1. Logon to the BI Launchpad (see Figure 6.282).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.229.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.282: BI Launch Pad
2. Use the menu Applications • Web Intelligence to start Web
   Intelligence (see Figure 6.283).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.230.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.283: New web Intelligence document
3. In Web Intelligence us the New option to start a new report.

4. Select the data source for creating a Web Intelligence report (see
   Figure 6.284). For our example, the data source is a BEx Query.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.231.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.284: Data Source-Excel File
5. In the next step you will be asked to select the InfoProvider and BEx
   Query (see Figure 6.285).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.232.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.285: Bex Query Selection
6. For our example, we are selecting the BEx Query and click OK.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.233.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.286: Web Intelligence Query Panel
7. The Web Intelligence Query Panel is shown (see Figure 6.286) and we
   can select the dimensions and measures for our report.

8. For our example, we are adding dimensions Country, Region, Product
   Group and measures Net Value, Profit, and Costs (see Figure 6.287).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.234.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.287: Query Panel
9.  Click Run Query to retrieve the data and build the first report.

10. In Web Intelligence, select the menu File and Save your report to
    the SAP BusinessObjects BI platform (see Figure 6.288).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.235.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.288: Saving Report
11. After you saved the report, select the Table in the Web Intelligence
    report.

12. Use a right-click on the Table (see Figure 6.289).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.236.jpg
	:align: center

13. Click Next in the next screen (see Figure 6.290).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.237.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.290: Publish as Web Service
14. The next steps checks for any potential duplicates of the Web
    Service. Click Next (see Figure 6.291).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.238.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.291: Duplicate Content
15. In the next step you enter a name for the published content of the
    report (see Figure 6.292). For our example, we use WEB_SERVICE_DEMO
    as Name.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.239.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.292: Define Content
16. You can also use the option Set Filters at this step to define,
    which filter options the Web Service should provide.

17. Click Next (see Figure 6.293).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.240.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.293: Publish Content
18. Select the server that you would like to use to host the new web
    service and click Create (see Figure 6.294).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.241.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.294: Publish Web Service
19. Enter the name of the newly Web Service. For our example, we will
    use the name WEB_SERVICE_WSDL_DEMO.

20. Click OK.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.242.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.295: Confirmation
21. You will receive a message about the creation of the Web Service.
    Click Close.

22. Click Finish.

At this point you created a Web Service based on the Table in the Web
Intelligence report. As next step we need to retrieve the Web Service
URL, so that we can use the Web Service URL in SAP BusinessObjects
Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

1. In Web Intelligence with the report open, now navigate to the Web
   Service Publisher details on the right hand side (see Figure 6.296).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.243.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.296: Web Service Publisher
2. Make sure you select the Web Service you created in the previous
   steps (see Figure 6.297).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.244.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.297: Web Service Properties
3. The Web Service Properties are shown in a separate screen and you can
   now copy the Web Service URL from the field WSDL URL.

Make sure you save the URL, as you will need the URL in SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

OData Service as Data Source
----------------------------

Using OData Service as Data Source with SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of VBX Release 2.3, you are provided with a generic ODATA
connectivity, so that a dashboard designer will be able to provide the
ODATA URL and can then consume the information as part of any component
in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio /Lumira Designer.

Export Service

The OData Source option requires the Export Service to be installed and
running prior to its usage. You will be configuring a Server URL as part
of the Export Service installation. The generated URL from the Export
Service will be the input for the Server URL properties in the Server
Configuration in Category General of the Additional Properties which
resembles the same function as that of WSDL.

Steps to build OData Service

Please follow the link:
https://blogs.sap.com/2012/10/26/step-by-step-guide-to-build-an-odata-service-based-on-rfcs-part-1/
which guides you on how to build a OData Service.

In the following steps we will use the OData Service as the Data Source
and make use of it in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer.

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer select the
   menu Application • New to create a new application.

2. Select the option SAPUI5m.

3. Enter a name for the new application.

4. Select the Blank template.

5. Click Create.

6. Navigate to the Outline.

7. Select the folder Data Sources and use a right-click (see Figure
   6.304).

.. figure:: _static/images/ods1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.304: Custom Data Source selected as OData Source
8. Select the menu Add Custom Data Source • OData Source.

9. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the OData Source Component
   (see Figure 6.305).

.. figure:: _static/images/ods2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.305: Additional Properties
10. Enter the Export Service URL into the property Server URL. This is
    the URL that contains the OData Source.

11. Enter the property Web Service URL that contains the OData Source in
    the General category (see Figure 6.306).

12. By default, the property Use Parameters will be disabled. When the
    Web Service URL contains the parameters/filters, then you should
    enable the property Use Parameters. For our example, the property
    Use Parameters is disabled.

.. figure:: _static/images/ods3.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.306: Server URL and Web Service URL
13. After entering the Web Service URL, click Fetch.

14. As soon as you click Fetch, the list of Tables will be shown.

15. For our example we use the table Products (see Figure 6.307).

.. figure:: _static/images/ods4.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.307: Table List
16. After entering the Web Service URL and selecting the Table Products,
    the available properties and attributes related to the Table will
    get loaded.

17. You can now add the attributes and configure each available field as
    Dimension or Measure (see Figure 6.308).

18. After we configured each element, click Build Table.

.. figure:: _static/images/ods5.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.308: Attributes Selection
The Web Service is now retrieving the information and after a short
period you can use the OData from the Web Service with the components in
your dashboard and you can assign the OData source from the Web Service
like any other data source.

 Additional Properties for OData Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In section 4.5.5 we discussed the common set of Additional Properties
for all charts. In this section we will outline the Additional
Properties that are specific to OData Source.

Constant Data Source as Data Source
-----------------------------------

Using Constant Data Source with SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of VBX Release 2.3, you are provided with Constant Data Source
option. Here, you can build your own data source table as the constant
data source and assign it for the VBX components.

In the following steps we will use the Constant Data Source which was
generated from your own data source structure and further assign it to
the VBX Components in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer.

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer select the
   menu Application • New to create a new application.

2. Select the option SAPUI5m.

3. Enter a name for the new application.

4. Select the Blank template.

5. Click Create.

6. Navigate to the Outline.

7. Select the folder Data Sources and use a right-click (see Figure
   6.309).

.. figure:: _static/images/cds1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.309: Constant Data Source being selected as Custom Data Source
8.  Select the menu Add Custom Data Source • Constant Data Source
    (BYOD).

9.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Constant Data Source
    Component. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please
    use the menu View • Additional Properties to activate the display of
    the properties.

10. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category General
    Settings in the Additional Properties (see Figure 6.310).

.. figure:: _static/images/cds2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.310: Building own data source
11. For our example, set the property Data Sample to the option Use
    BYOD. The other options are Experimental Sample Queries and Custom
    Data String.

12. Now you can generate your own data source by providing the inputs
    for Dimension 1 as Product Name, Dimension 2 as Product Category,
    Measure 1 as Sales, Measure 2 as Profit and Measure 3 as Quantity
    (see Figure 6.310).

13. Now click Build Data.

14. Add a Column Bar Chart from the VBX Chart into your application.

15. Now assign the Constant Data Source to the Column Bar Chart
    component.

16. Based on the above configuration, you will be able to visualize
    Column Bar Chart based on the assigned Constant Data Source which
    was generated from your own data source (see Figure 6.311).

Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart
-------------------------------

The Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart component provides you with the
ability to configure a start page with a variety of charts and in
addition to define a drill path based on the available dimensions in the
assigned data source. Based on the drill path, you will then be able to
drill to the next dimension and based on the dimension members the
component will then generate one visualization per dimension member, for
example one column chart per country visualizing the revenue by month.

Data Source Requirements 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The assigned data source for the Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart
requires a minimum of two dimensions in the rows and one measure in the
columns.

How to use the Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps you can see, how you can setup a simple scenario
with the Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart.

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a Data Source to your project. For this example, we will assume
   that your data source has four dimensions – Calendar Year, Item
   Category, Item Sub category, and Customer Gender and one measure –
   Order Cost.

3. Add a Column Bar Chart and a Line Chart from the category VBX Charts
   to your project.

4. Add the Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart from the category VBX
   Utilities to your project.

5. Now assign your data source to the Column Bar Chart, Line Chart, and
   assign your data source as well to the Small Multiples (Trellis)
   Chart.

6. Now navigate to the category General and to the sub category Layout
   in the Additional Properties of the Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart
   (see Figure 6.312).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.251.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.312: Category General – Layout 
7.  Activate the property Enable Navigation Panel so that during run
    time, the Navigation Panel will be displayed at the left side so
    that you can select which dimension member will be used to filter
    the data set and navigate along the drill path.

8.  By activating the property Enable Start Page, the component provides
    you with the option to configure a Start Page and the elements that
    will be shown on the start page.

9.  For our example, click the Refresh button against the property
    Template Components and select both the Column Bar chart and the
    Line Chart to the project as part of the Template Components (see
    Figure 6.312).

10. In addition, we can also assign any other chart that is part of our
    SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project to the
    list of Template components.

11. After we assigned both the Column Bar Chart and Line Chart for the
    Template Components, we can now define their entries as part of the
    Start Page Components.

12. For our example, we will first add the Column Bar Chart to the Start
    Page Components by setting the values for the properties Name, Type
    and Measure as shown in Figure 6.313.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.252.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.313: Start Page Components as Column Bar Chart 
13. Next, we will add the Line Chart to the Start Page Components by
    setting the values for the properties Name, Type and Measure as
    shown in Figure 6.314.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.253.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.314: Start Page Components as Line Chart
14. Based on the above configuration, you should see the Column Bar
    Chart and the Line Chart as part of the start page which shows the
    measure Order Cost by the dimension Calendar Year (see Figure
    6.315).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.254.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.315: Start page component assigned as Column Bar Chart and Line Chart Chart

15. In addition, you have the ability to add new visualizations to the
    start page by clicking on the “Add Component” option. All components
    configured as Template Components are available to be added to the
    Start Page (see Figure 6.315).

16. After clicking the Add Component, you will be able to assign the
    details for the properties Name, Type, and Measure and the selected
    component will be added to the Start Page. (see Figure 6.316). The
    dimension for the component will be automatically be based on the
    data source and the drill path in the data source.

.. figure:: _static/images/6.255.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.316: Component Configuration 
17. In case you now click onto the Column Bar Chart as part of the Start
    page, the drill path of the data source is being followed and for
    our example, the Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart is then showing the
    dimension members for the dimension Calendar Year in the Navigation
    Panel, and for each Calendar Year member you will see the Column Bar
    Chart being displayed with the measure Order Cost broken down by the
    dimension Item Category. (see Figure 6.317).

.. figure:: _static/images/6.256.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 6.317: Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart with Calendar Year Dimension members Dimension members

18. Now when you click the **All Items** link in the Navigation panel,
    the drill path of the data source is being followed and for our
    example, the Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart will be then showing
    the dimension members for the dimension Item Category in the
    Navigation Panel, and for each Item Category member you will see the
    Column Bar Chart being displayed with the measure Order Cost broken
    down by the dimension Item Sub category (see Figure 6.318).

	:align: center

19. At this stage, if you need to view the Trellis for the particular
    Dimension Member(s) you can select the Member(s) from the Navigation
    Panel and view the drill path for your selection. For our example,
    the dimension members “Books” and “Electronics” which belong to the
    dimension Item Category have been selected and the corresponding
    drill path is displayed as shown in Figure 6.319.

20. In case if you have once again clicked the **All Items** link in the
    Navigation panel, the drill path of the data source is being
    followed and for our example, the Small Multiples (Trellis) Chart
    will be then showing the dimension members for the dimension Item
    Subcategory in the Navigation Panel, and for each Item Subcategory
    member you will see the Column Bar Chart being displayed with the
    measure Order Cost broken down by the dimension Customer Gender (see
    Figure 6.320).

Speciality Charts Overview
--------------------------

The next part of the Visual BI Extensions (VBX) suite, are the
Speciality Charts (listed in Figure 7.1).

The VBX Speciality Charts (see Figure 7.1) include:

-  Gantt Chart

   A Gantt Chart shows activities (tasks or events) displayed along a
   given timeline. On the left side of the chart is the Data Grid, which
   displays the activities or resources based on dimension members. On
   the right hand side the Gantt chart displays a visual representation
   of certain activities in the typical bar display.

-  | Data Utility
   | Data Utility Component provides the Data Utility features in the
     run time. Here the user can reconfigure and create virtual copies
     of the assigned data source and select the dimensions and measures
     that should be used for the application, instead of using the
     complete data set.

Gantt Chart

Data Source Requirements for a Gantt Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Gantt Chart has a list of dimension / measures that can be configured
as part of the data source assignment, depending on which information is
available. Some of those dimensions are mandatory for the Gantt chart to
work, some of them are optional. You also have the option to leverage
these values in form of measure values.

+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Field Name               | Required / Optional |
+==========================+=====================+
| Actual Start Date        | Required            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Actual End Date          | Required            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Planned Start Date       | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Planned End Date         | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Progress Value           | Required            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Primary Connector        | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Primary Connector Type   | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Secondary Connector      | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Secondary Connector Type | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+

Table 7.1: Gantt Chart Data Requirements

In case some of these informations – for example the Actual Start Date
and Actual End Date – are stored in form of measures in the assigned
data source, you can use the property Date Values as Measure(s) to all
the selection of measures as part of the data assignment.

As you can see in the Table above, the Gantt chart is also offering the
option to define connector options between the individual tasks. In
regards to the Connector Type, the following Table outlines the
available options.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Connector Type Value              | Description                       |
+===================================+===================================+
| StartStart                        | The second task can’t start until |
|                                   | the first task starts.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| StartFinish                       | The second task can’t finish      |
|                                   | until the first begins.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| FinishStart                       | The second task can’t start until |
|                                   | the first is done.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| FinishFinish                      | The second task can’t finish      |
|                                   | until the first task is done.     |

Table 7.3: Sample Data Set with Connector

As you can see in the sample data, you can also pass more than one value
for the Primary Connector and Primary Connector Type, which then would
expect an array of values as shown in the sample data for ID 28.

How to use a Gantt Chart

Table 7.4: Sample Data

You can follow the steps below to configure the Gantt Chart:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source contains one measure – Progress - and six
    dimensions Dimension 1, Dimension 2, Actual Start Date, Actual End
    Date, Primary Connector and Primary Connector Type.

3.  Dimension 1 and Dimension 2 contain the information for the Task
    names.

4.  Add a Gantt Chart from the VBX Specialty Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

5.  Assign the data source to the Gantt Chart.

6.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart (see Figure
    7.3).

7.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

8.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
    the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart.

9.  For our example, in the area General Settings set the property
    Select Chart Type to the option Gantt.

10. Now navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data
    Series (see Figure 7.3). In the area Chart Settings you can now
    activate, which dimension should be displayed as part of the Data
    Grid on the left hand side by selecting those dimension as part of
    the Data Grid Dimensions. For our example set the property Data Grid
    Members to the dimensions Dimension 1 and Dimension 2 (see Figure
    7.3).

11. Activate the option ID in the Data Grid Additional Columns to
    display a generated ID number for each task.

12. Activate the option Dimensions in the Data Grid Additional Columns
    to display the selected dimensions from the Data Grid.

13. Activate the property Dates in Measures when the date values are
    configured as measures in the underlying data source.

14. For our example the property Dates in Measures is disabled.

15. The Date Format property needs to be selected based on the Date
    Format provided by the assigned data source. For our example, we set
    the property Date Format to the value MM/dd/yyyy.

In the next steps you can configure the dimension assignments for each
of the elements of the Gantt Chart.

1. Set the property Actual Start Date to the dimension Actual Start
   Date.

2. Set the property Actual End Date to the dimension Actual End Date.

3. Set the property Progress to the measure Progress.

4. Now assign dimension Connector To (1) to the Primary Connector
   property.

5. Assign the dimension Connector Type (1) to the property Primary
   Connector Type.

Figure 7.3: Category Data 
6. Based on the configured properties, you will be able to view the
   Gantt Chart (see Figure 7.4). With respect to the selection of
   connector and connector type, you can observe that in our example,
   the Task Systems Architecture will start simultaneously when the
   tasks Application Architecture and High Level Design get started and
   it shows the Start to Start connector lines.

Figure 7.4: Gantt Chart
Gantt Chart as Resource Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Resource Chart shows the timeline of the individual resource. A
resource could be an actual person with an assigned task, or a resource
could be an actual resource, such as a car or a machine, required for
the task.

Data Source Requirements for Gantt Chart as Resource Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general a Resource chart will require 2 dimensions, where 1 dimension
represents the Resource and one dimension represents the task. In
addition, the Resource chart requires information such as the Actual
Start Date and the Actual End date.

+------------------------+---------------------+
| Field Name             | Required / Optional |
+========================+=====================+
| Dimension for Resource | Required            |
+------------------------+---------------------+
| Dimension for Task     | Required            |
+------------------------+---------------------+
| Actual Start Date      | Required            |
+------------------------+---------------------+
| Actual End Date        | Required            |
+------------------------+---------------------+

Table 7.5: Gantt Chart Data Requirements

In case some of these informations – for example the Actual Start Date
and Actual End Date – are stored in form of measures in the assigned
data source, you can use the property Date Values as Measure(s) to all
the selection of measures as part of the data assignment.

How to use Gantt Chart as a Resource Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline, how you can setup a new Gantt
Chart as Resource Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows two measures – Start Date and End Date -
    and two dimensions Sub Task and Resource.

3.  Add a Gantt Chart from VBX Specialty Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Assign the data source to the Gantt Chart.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart (see Figure
    7.5).

6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

7.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
    the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart.

8.  For our example, in the area General Settings set the property
    Select Chart Type to the option Resource.

9.  Now navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data
    Series (see Figure 7.5). In the area Chart Settings you can now
    activate, which dimension should be displayed as part of the Data
    Grid on the left hand side by selecting those dimension as part of
    the Data Grid Dimensions. For our example set the property Data Grid
    Members to the dimensions Dimension 1 and Dimension 2, which
    represent the Resource and Task information.

10. Activate the property Dates in Measures when the date values are
    configured as measures in the underlying data source.

11. For our example the property Dates in Measures is disabled.

12. The Date Format property needs to be selected based on the Date
    Format provided by the assigned data source. For our example, we set
    the property Date Format to the value MM/dd/yyyy.

13. Set the property Actual Start Date to the value Actual Start Date.

14. Set the property Actual End Date to the value Actual End Date.

15. The property Resource Color Type can be configured with the
    following options:

-  Color by Dimension – In our example, the dimension is Sub Task.

-  Color by Dimension members - In our example, the dimension member
   will be retrieve based on dimension Resource.

16. For our example, set the property Resource Color Type to the option
    Color by Dimension which is Sub Task.

17. Set the property Series Color to the desired color for each
    dimension Sub Task (see Figure 7.5)

Figure 7.6: Gantt as Resource Chart
Gantt Resource Chart 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Gantt Resource Chart shows the Resource’s Tasks displayed along a
given timeline. On the left side of the chart is the Data Grid, which
displays the activities and resources based on dimension members. On the
right hand side, the Gantt Resource Chart displays a visual
representation of the the Timeline bar showing the Resource which get
split based on their Task Start and End Time.

.. figure:: _static/images/4.292.jpg

Figure 7.7: Gantt Resource Chart
Data Source Requirements for a Gantt Resource Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Gantt Resource Chart has a list of dimension / measures that can be
configured as part of the data source assignment, depending on which
information is available. Some of those dimensions are mandatory for the
Gantt chart to work, some of them are optional. You also have the option
to leverage these values in form of measure values.

+-------------------+---------------------+
| Field Name        | Required / Optional |
+===================+=====================+
| Actual Start Date | Required            |
+-------------------+---------------------+
| Actual End Date   | Required            |
+-------------------+---------------------+
| Progress Value    | Required            |
+-------------------+---------------------+

Table 7.6: Gantt Resource Chart Data Requirements

In case some of these informations – for example the Actual Start Date
and Actual End Date – are stored in form of measures in the assigned
data source, you can use the property Date Values as Measure(s) to all
the selection of measures as part of the data assignment.

How to use a Gantt Resource Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline, how you can setup a new Gantt
Resource Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source contains one measure – Progress - and five
    dimensions Dimension 1, Dimension 2, Dimension 3, Actual Start Date
    and Actual End Date.

3.  Dimension 1 and Dimension 2 contains the information for the Task
    names and Dimension 3 contains the information for the Resource.

4.  Add a Gantt Chart from the VBX Specialty Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

5.  Assign the data source to the Gantt Chart.

6.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart (see Fig2).

7.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

8.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
    the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart.

9.  For our example, in the area General Settings set the property
    Select Chart Type to the option Gantt Resource.

10. Now navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data
    Series (see Figure 7.8). In the area Chart Settings you can now
    activate, which dimension should be displayed as part of the Data
    Grid on the left hand side by selecting those dimension as part of
    the Data Grid Dimensions. For our example set the property Data Grid
    Members to the dimensions Dimension 1 and Dimension 2 that
    represents the Task and Sub Task Names and set the Dimension 3 that
    represents the Resource which is mandatory (see Figure 7.8).

11. Activate the option ID in the Data Grid Additional Columns to
    display a generated ID number for each task.

12. Activate the option Dimensions in the Data Grid Additional Columns
    to display the selected dimensions from the Data Grid.

13. Activate the property Enable Date Values from Measures when the date
    values are configured as measures in the underlying data source.

14. For our example the property Enable Date Values from Measures is
    disabled.

15. Activate the property Display Individual Task.

16. The Date Format property needs to be selected based on the Date
    Format provided by the assigned data source. For our example, we set
    the property Date Format to the value MM/dd/yyyy.

In the next steps you can configure the dimension assignments for each
of the elements of the Gantt

Chart.

1. Set the property Actual Start Date to the dimension Actual Start
   Date.

2. Set the property Actual End Date to the dimension Actual End Date.

3. Set the property Progress to the measure Progress.

Figure 7.8: Category Data 
4. Based on the configured properties, you will be able to view the
   Gantt Resource Chart (see Figure 7.9). In our example, since the
   option Display Individual Task in the Additional Properties is
   activated, you can visualize the Gantt Resource Chart with two
   individual resources Bonnie and Mike working in the same timeline for
   a specific task Systems architecture. You can observe that Mike is
   working in two different time slots within the same timeline.

5. When the option Display Individual Task in the Additional Properties
   is not activated, then you can visualize the Gantt Resource Chart
   showing two individual resources Kimberley and Samuel working in two
   different timelines for a specific task Feasibility Study (see Figure
   7.10).

Data Utility Component
----------------------

As part of the Release 2.3, you are provided with the new Data Utility
Component which provides the Data Utility features in the run time. Here
the user can reconfigure and create virtual copies of the assigned data
source and select the dimensions and measures that should be used for
the application, instead of using the complete data set. The Data
Utility Component also comes with three different component modes as
listed below:

1. Simple Mode

2. Mobile Mode

3. Mobile Advanced Mode

There is another option Enable No UI Mode where the Dashboard user can
configure the Data Utility component settings without using the above
three component modes. When the option Enable No UI Mode is activated
then you will be unable to configure the settings for the Data Utility
component using the above listed three component modes.

The VBX Data Utility Component can be also applied for the native
components of SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.

.. _data-source-requirements-4:

Data Source Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data source requirements for the Data Utility component involves one
Source Dataset and multiple Target Data sources. The Source Dataset
should be assigned to the Data Utility component and the multiple Target
Data sources like the Data Utility Source (so called the Custom Data
Source) can only be assigned to any number of chart components depending
on the choice of the Dashboard Designer.

In the upcoming sections, you will be able to follow the steps on how to
configure the Data Utility component using the three different component
modes – Simple Mode, Mobile Mode and Mobile Advanced Mode.

Visual BI Extensions for SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer (VBX) – Maps
===========================================================================================

Maps Overview
-------------

As a part of the overall Visual BI Extensions (VBX) suite, you also
receive a set of mapping components (see Figure 8.1).

.. figure:: _static/images/8.001.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.1: VBX Maps
The Maps components of the Visual BI Extensions (VBX) include:

-  | Bubble / Heat GeoMap
   | This component allows you to represent measure values in form of
     choropleth maps and in form of bubble maps. In addition, the
     component comes with a large set of predefined maps and the ability
     to create custom maps based on GeoJSON definitions.

-  | Location Analyzer
   | This component allows you to leverage longitude and latitude based
     maps and visualize the information in different forms of map
     layers, such as Marker Layer, Heat Layer, Cluster Layer, Choropleth
     Layer, and Bubble Layer. In addition, you also have the ability to
     define custom map layer using a GeoJSON definition

Drill Down Capabilities

Please note, that the Bubble Map visualization of the Bubble / Heat
GeoMap component does not provide drill down capabilities.

Bubble / Heat GeoMap
--------------------

The Bubble / Heat GeoMap component allows you to visualize measure
values in form of a choropleth map or a bubble map. In addition the
component provides a large set of standard maps out of the box.

Data Visualization for Heat Maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of the VBX Release 2.3, you have the ability to visualize the
Heat Map using the property Enable Pie Map in the Additional Properties
where the measures will be represented in the form of Pie Charts for the
Dimensions selected in the Map.

For our example, you can follow the steps below to configure the
property Enable Map Pie for data visualization in the Heat Map
component:

1. Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
   Designer.

2. Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume that
   our data source has a dimension State and three measures – Licenced
   Beds, Operating Beds and Revenue.

3. Add a Bubble/Heat GeoMap from the VBX Maps to your SAP
   BusinessObjects Design Studio / SAP Lumira Designer project.

4. Assign the data source to the Bubble/Heat GeoMap.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Bubble/Heat GeoMap.

6. In the Additional Properties of the Bubble/Heat GeoMap component in
   the Category General you can navigate to the subcategory General
   Settings (see Figure 8.2).

.. figure:: _static/images/dv1.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.2: Category General
7.  For our example, set the property Select Map Group to the option
    Heat.

8.  Set the property Select Map Category to the option Countries.

9.  Set the country as “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA”.

10. Navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Map Definition
    (see Figure 8.3).

.. figure:: _static/images/dv2.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.3: Category Data
11. For our example, set the property Select Axis Type to the option
    Linear.

12. Set the property Technical ID/Index Based to the option Technical
    ID.

13. Set the property Select Primary Measure to the option Licenced Beds.

14. Now navigate to the category General and to the sub category General
    Settings.

15. Activate the property Enable Map Pie (see Figure 8.4).

.. figure:: _static/images/dv3.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.4: Category General
16. Based on the above configuration you will be able to view the Data
    Visualization for the Heat Map being displayed where the measure
    Licenced Beds shows more intensity in the maps (shown in purple
    color). You also can view that for each State being assigned as
    Dimension, there will be a Pie Chart generated for each State
    representing the distribution of measures (see Figure 8.5).

.. figure:: _static/images/dv4.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.5: Data Visualization for Heat Map
Custom Data Label and Custom Tooltip Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Bubble/Heat GeoMap component, you also have the ability to create a
customized Data Label and Tooltip using a small text editor as part of
the Additional Properties.

In the Additional Properties of the Bubble/Heat GeoMap component in the
Category Appearance you can navigate to the subcategory Data Label,
which provides access to all the settings related to the Data Labels for
the Bubble/Heat GeoMap (see Figure 8.6).

.. figure:: _static/images/m6.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.6: Data Label Properties
Part of the Data Label properties is also a small editor, which allows
you to create a customized data label (see Figure 8.7).

.. figure:: _static/images/m7.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.7: Custom Data Label
Using this small editor you have the ability to simply type and format
text, as well as integrate data and meta-data from the assigned data
source. Using the menu items Dimension and Measure, you can integrate
the information from the assigned Dimension and Measure(s) into the Data
Label.

When clicking on Dimension, you will have the option to select the
dimension as part of the property Name. By using the option Metadata,
you can include the name of the dimension into the data label and by
using the option Member the dimension member that is shown in the
Bubble/Heat GeoMap will then be mentioned in the data label.

In addition you can configure the property Display Type to either show
the Key or the Text for the dimension member (see Figure 8.8).

.. figure:: _static/images/m8.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.8: Dimension Selector
When clicking on Measure, you will receive a very similar list of
options for the measures in the Bubble/Heat GeoMap (see Figure 8.9).

.. figure:: _static/images/m9.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.9: Measure Selector
Here you also have the ability to first select the Measure and then
choose between the Metadata and the Value of the Measure. In case you
choose the Metadata option, you can then also choose between the Key and
Text for the Display Type. After inserting the text and the selected
elements from the dimension and measures, the text editor is showing the
elements of the data labels (see Figure 8.10).

.. figure:: _static/images/m10.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.10: Custom Data Label
In the given example we selected the Text from the Member from dimension
Product Group and the measure value from the measure displayed in the
Bubble/Heat GeoMap. You also have this option available for the Tooltip
as part of the Additional Properties in the category Appearance >
Tooltip.

Number Format for Data Label and Tooltip

Any configurations as part of the Number Format settings in the
Additional Properties will automatically be used by the Data Label and
Tooltip display – including any custom Data Label and Tooltip.

Data Source Requirements for the Bubble / Heat Geo Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Bubble/ Heat Geo Map is able to use dimension values – such a
Regions or Countries – to identify the geographical area as well as
longitude and latitude values. In addition the component is able to
provide drill down capabilities, for example drilling from a Country map
to a Region map.

The exact data source requirement depends on the type of navigation you
would like to provide to the user, for example a map that should show
Country and Region information would require a data source with two
dimensions and one measure.

How to use the Bubble / Heat Geo Map Component for a Heat Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline how you can use the Bubble / Heat
Geo Map component and visualize the information. For our example we will
assume that our data source contains the following elements:

-  Dimension Country in the Rows.

-  Dimension Region in the Rows.

-  Dimension Product in the Rows.

-  Measure Revenue in the Columns.

You can follow the steps below to setup a new Bubble / Heat Geo Map
Component:

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a new
   project.

2. Add a new Data Source as part of your new project. The type and
   structure of the data source should be similar to what we outlined
   above.

3. Add the Bubble / Heat Geo Map component from the VBX Maps to your
   project.

4. Assign the data source to the map component.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the map Component. In case
   the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View
   **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
   properties\ **.**

6. Navigate to the category General and the subcategory General Settings
   (see Figure 8.11).

11. In this category, you have the option to select the property
    “Technical ID / Index Based” that has two different types as listed
    below:

-  Technical ID

-  Index Based

The option Technical ID allows you to specify the dimensions and
measures based on their technical names / technical IDs.

The option Index Based allows you to specify an index value (zero based
index), and the index will specify the position of the dimension or
measure in the assigned data source. For example a index of 2 for the
measure will then use the third measure (0, 1, 2) of the assigned data
source.

12. For our example we will select the option “Technical ID” and map the
    items in the following steps.

13. Set the Primary Measure to the measure from the data source – in our
    example Net Value.

14. Set the Data Type for the Map Level 1 area to the option Dimension.

In the last set of steps we used a standard data set and visualized the
information in form of a Heat Map. The process of setting up a Bubble
map is very similar, but allows to use up to two measures.

How to use the Bubble / Heat Geo Map Component for a Bubble Map using Technical ID option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline how you can use the Bubble / Heat
Geo Map component and visualize the information. For our example we will
assume that our data source contains the following elements:

-  Dimension Country in the Rows.

-  Measure Cost in the Columns.

-  Measure Net Value in the Columns.

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a Bubble Map
with two measures:

1.  In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a
    new project.

2.  Add a new Data Source as part of your new project. The type and
    structure of the data source should be similar to what we outlined
    above.

3.  Add the Bubble / Heat Geo Map component from the VBX Maps to your
    project.

4.  Assign the data source to the map component.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the map Component. In case
    the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu View
    **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    properties\ **.**

6.  Navigate to the category General and the subcategory General
    Settings.

7.  For our example we are configuring the following values:

    -  Map Type Bubble

    -  Select Map World

    -  Select Map WORLD MAP

8.  For the other values we will use the default values.

9.  Navigate to the category Data and the subcategory Map Definition
    (see Figure 8.17).

10. Follow the similar steps as executed for the configuration of Bubble
    / Heat Geo Map Component for a Heat Map using the Dimension
    Selection options.

Figure 8.18: Bubble Color Ranges
17. Activate the option Enable Color Ranges.

18. Set the Maximum Value Type property to the option Result (Max).
    Using this option the maximum of the Color Ranges will be based on
    the maximum value retrieved from the data source.

19. Set the Range Type to Percentage.

20. You can now use the Create Range button to define the From and To
    values for the Color Ranges. As additional option you can also
    define the Opacity for each of the Color Ranges.

21. In addition you can specify the following details:

    -  Bubble Minimum Size: Here you can enter either an absolute value
       in pixels or you can enter a percentage value. The percentage
       value is based on the overall Map Height / Width (whichever value
       is the larger).

    -  Bubble Maximum Size: Here you can enter either an absolute value
       in pixels or you can enter a percentage value. The percentage
       value is based on the overall Map Height / Width (whichever value
       is the larger).

22. For our example enter 5% as Bubble Minimum Size and enter 10% as
    Bubble Maximum Size.

23. You should now have a map that shows two measures – one measure
    being represented by the Bubble Size and the second measure being
    represented by the bubble color (see Figure 8.19).

How to use the Bubble / Heat Geo Map Component with a GeoJSON File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline how you can use the Bubble / Heat
Geo Map component and visualize the information in combination with a
GeoJSON File. For our example we will assume that our data source
contains the following elements:

-  Dimension Region in the Rows.

-  Measure Net Value in the Columns.

In addition we assume that we use a GeoJSON file representing the
information of the states in the United States. Using a GeoJSON File you
can define your own geographic areas based on the map that you selected
as the starting map in the category General.

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a new
   project.

2. Add a new Data Source as part of your new project. The type and
   structure of the data source should be similar to what we outlined
   above.

3. Add the Bubble / Heat Geo Map component from the VBX Maps to your
   project.

4. Assign the data source to the map component.

5. Navigate to the category General and the subcategory General
   Settings.

6. For our example we are configuring the following values:

   -  Map Type Heat

   -  Select Map Countries

   -  Select Map United States of America

7. For the other values we will use the default values.

8. Navigate to the category Data and the subcategory GeoJSON (see Figure
   8.23).

.. figure:: _static/images/m23.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.23: Category Data  - GeoJSON 
9.  Activate the option Enable GeoJSON.

10. Enter a GeoJSON Layer Name.

11. Set the Format to the option GeoJSON.

12. Set the Source to the option Text.

13. Now copy and paste the GeoJSON syntax into the Text box.

14. After you entered the GeoJSON text you will see a set of sample rows
    (see Figure 8.24).

.. figure:: _static/images/m24.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.24: GeoJSON
15. You can now use the Attributes from the GeoJSON file (see Figure
    8.24) and map each of the available attributes to a dimension from
    the assigned data source using the Create button in the Attribute
    Mapping area.

16. In addition you can choose, if you would like to map the Key or the
    Text value of the dimension to the GeoJSON Attribute using the
    column Key / Text.

17. For our example, we will map the Attribute Name to the Dimension
    Region and we will map it to the Text value of the Region (see
    Figure 8.25).

.. figure:: _static/images/m25.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.25: Attribute Mapping 
18. Now navigate to the category Data and the subcategory Map Definition
    (see Figure 8.26).

.. figure:: _static/images/m26.jpg
	:align: center

26. You have three different rule types: Single Measure, Measure
    Calculation, and Target Value. You can find the details on these
    different rule types in section 4.3.10 as part of the section for
    Conditional Formatting for charts.

27. Select the option Single Measure.

28. You can then choose a measure that will be compared against another
    value.

29. In our example we will use measure Net Value for the Comparison
    Measure.

30. For the Comparison Operator we use Greater Than.

31. For the Comparison Value Type we will use the option Dynamic.

32. For the Dynamic Selection Value we will set the value Measure
    Selection.

33. We will then use the measure Forecast for the Comparison Value.

34. And we will then set a color for the rule.

35. Click on Add to add the Rule to our map.

36. Based on our definition the rule will now be applied and the
    matching Countries will be displayed in the selected color.

Location Analyzer
-----------------

Location Analyzer is a mapping component that allows geographic analysis
based on Longitude and Latitude information or based on a complete
address location or a GeoJSON definition. The Location Analyzer
component allows you to setup different set of layers, such as a Marker
Layer, Cluster Layer, Choropleth, Bubble, and a Heat Map Layer.

Custom Data Label and Custom Tooltip Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Location Analyzer component, you also have the ability to create a
customized Data Label and Tooltip using a small text editor as part of
the Additional Properties.

In the Additional Properties of the Location Analyzer component in the
Category Appearance you can navigate to the subcategory Data Label,
which provides access to all the settings related to the Data Labels for
the Location Analyzer (see Figure 8.30).

Figure 8.31: Custom Data Label
Using this small editor you have the ability to simply type and format
text, as well as integrate data and meta-data from the assigned data
source. Using the menu items Dimension and Measure, you can integrate
the information from the assigned Dimension and Measure(s) into the Data
Label.

When clicking on Dimension, you will have the option to select the
dimension as part of the property Name. By using the option Metadata,
you can include the name of the dimension into the data label and by
using the option Member the dimension member that is shown in the
Location Analyzer will then be mentioned in the data label.

In addition you can configure the property Display Type to either show
the Key or the Text for the dimension member (see Figure 8.32).

Any configurations as part of the Number Format settings in the
Additional Properties will automatically be used by the Data Label and
Tooltip display – including any custom Data Label and Tooltip.

Data Source Requirements for the Location Analyzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Location Analyzer requires a data source with both Longitude and
Latitude information available or with a complete address in the source
data. The information such as Longitude and Latitude can be leveraged in
form of a dimension, measure, or an attribute. In addition you have the
option to setup a custom map using a GeoJSON syntax and map the GeoJSON
attributes to your data source.

Support for Multiple Data Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with VBX 1.68, the Location Analyzer provides the ability to
leverage multiple data sources in a single map component as part of SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer. To be able to
leverage multiple data sources with the Location Analyzer, you have to
create a technical component called Data Provider for each data source
you would like to use in combination with the Location Analyzer.

In the following steps we will outline, how you can enable the option to
leverage multiple data source and configure those as part of the
Location Analyzer component.

1. We will assume that you are in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP
   Lumira Designer.

2. For our example, we have a new application with several Data Sources
   (see Figure 8.35).

.. figure:: _static/images/m35.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.35: Application Outline
3. Our application has 4 data sources. As next step we navigate to the
   folder Technical Components.

4. Use a right-click on the folder Technical Components (see Figure
   8.36).

.. figure:: _static/images/m36.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.36: Technical Components
5. Select the menu option Create **•** Data Provider.

6. A new Data Provider is being created as part of the Technical
   Components (see Figure 8.37).

.. figure:: _static/images/m37.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.37: Data Provider
7. Select the newly created Data Provider.

8. Navigate to the Standard Properties of the Data Provider (see Figure
   8.38).

.. figure:: _static/images/m38.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.38: Standard Properties
9.  You can now assign the Data Source from your application, which you
    would like to use, to the Data Provider.

10. In our example, we will assign data source DS_1 to the Data Provider
    1.

11. Now add a Location Analyzer from the VBX Maps to your application.

12. Select the Location Analyzer component.

13. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Location Analyzer.

14. Navigate to the category Data and the subcategory Source Data (see
    Figure 8.39).

.. figure:: _static/images/m39.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.39: Additional Properties
15. Activate the option Enable Multi Source Mode.

16. After you enabled the Multi Source Mode, you can then choose the
    configured Data Provider and configure it in the same way as you
    were configuring the standard data source previously. You can setup
    the configuration for each Data Provider individually.

17. After you configured the Data Source details as part of the Data
    category in the Additional Properties, you can then assign a data
    source for each individual map layer, as shown below for the Marker
    Layer (see Figure 8.40).

How to use the Location Analyzer – Marker Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline the steps required to setup a new
map using the Location Analyzer component and to setup a new layer
representing the data in form of Markers. For our example we will
assume, that the data source contains the following elements:

-  Dimension City Name in the Rows.

-  Dimension City Longitude in the Rows.

-  Dimension City Latitude in the Rows.

-  Measure Revenue in the Columns.

You can follow the steps below to setup a new Location Analyzer
Component:

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a new
   project.

2. Add a new Data Source as part of your new project. The type and
   structure of the data source should be similar to what we outlined
   above.

3. Add the Location Analyzer component from the VBX Maps to your
   project.

4. Assign the data source to the map component.

5. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Location Analyzer
   Component. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please
   use the menu View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display
   of the properties\ **.**

6. Navigate to the category Data and subcategory Source Data.

7. Set the option Address Type to the value Latitude / Longitude (see
   Figure 8.41).

.. figure:: _static/images/m41.jpg
	:align: center

8.  Here you can configure the data source assignment to the map
    component.

9.  Select the dimension City Latitude for the property Choose Latitude.

10. Select the dimension City Longitude for the property Choose
    Longitude.

11. Navigate to the category General and the subcategory General
    Settings (see Figure 8.42).

12. Here you can configure the starting point of the map for the start
    of the dashboard using the Initial Latitude and Initial Longitude
    values. You also have the option to move the marker in the map.

13. In addition you can configure the initial zoom level as well as the
    maximum zoom level.

14. Navigate to the category Map Layers and the subcategory General
    Settings (see Figure 8.43).

.. figure:: _static/images/m43.jpg

How to use the Location Analyzer – GeoJSON Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will outline the steps required to setup a new
map using the Location Analyzer and adding a new layer to the map by
using a GeoJSON definition. For our example we assume that we do have a
data source with a dimension Region, which lists the states of the US
and we also have a GeoJSON file outlining the borders of the US.

You can follow the steps below to setup a new Location Analyzer
Component:

1. Start SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer in the
   SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform Mode.

2. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a new
   project.

3. Add a new Data Source as part of your new project. The type and
   structure of the data source should be similar to what we outlined
   above.

4. Add the Location Analyzer component from the VBX Maps to your
   project.

5. Assign the data source to the map component.

6. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Location Analyzer
   Component. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please
   use the menu View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display
   of the properties\ **.**

7. Navigate to the category Map Layers.

8. Navigate to the subcategory GeoJSON.

9. Click Create Layer (see Figure 8.49).

SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform as storage option

Please note, that the option to upload or select the GeoJSON file to /
from the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform is only supported with SAP
BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer release 1.6 or higher.

In this section we added a GeoJSON Layer to our map, but so far we have
not added any display of a measure value to it. In the next set of steps
we will combine the GeoJSON layer with a Choropleth layer and a Bubble
Layer.

How to use the Location Analyzer – Choropleth Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will use the GeoJSON Layer we created
previously based on the GeoJSON definition for the states (Region) in
the US and we will now add a Choropleth Layer on top of the GeoJSON
layer. As part of these steps we will link the GeoJSON Layer to our data
source and in that way visualize the values in form of a choropleth
layer.

You can follow the steps below to setup a new Choropleth Layer:

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer open the
   application with the Location Analyzer component and the GeoJSON
   Layer we created previously.

2. Select the Location Analyzer Component.

3. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Location Analyzer
   Component. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please
   use the menu View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display
   of the properties\ **.**

4. Navigate to the area Map Layers in the Additional Properties.

5. Navigate to the subcategory Choropleth.

6. Enable the option Activate Choropleth Layer.

7. Click Create Layer (see Figure 8.52).

.. figure:: _static/images/m52.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.52: Choropleth Layer  
8.  Enter a Layer Name.

9.  Select the previously created GeoJSON Layer for the option Choose
    GeoJSON Layer.

10. Select a measure from the data source for the choropleth layer.

11. Configure a Scale Type. You have the option between Quantile,
    Quantize, Linear, or Custom.

12. Select a Color Option. You can choose between a manual color scheme
    creation or you can choose a color scheme from Color Brewer for the
    property Configure Color.

13. For our example we are selecting the option Color Spectrum.

14. In the next option we are selecting a Sequential color scheme (see
    Figure 8.53).

.. figure:: _static/images/m53.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.53: Color Scheme 
15. Select one of the prebuilt color schemes.

16. Click Add / Update.

.. figure:: _static/images/m54.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.54: Choropleth Map  
Your Choropleth map should now be visible as part of your Location
Analyzer Component.

How to use the Location Analyzer – Bubble Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will use the Location Analyzer component and
setup a Bubble Layer Map. For the Bubble Layer map we require a data
source with Longitude and Latitude values.

For our example we will assume, that the data source contains the
following elements:

-  Dimension Longitude in the Rows.

-  Dimension Latitude in the Rows.

-  Measure Revenue in the Columns.

-  Measure Profit in the Columns.

You can follow the steps below to setup a new Location Analyzer
Component:

1.  In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a
    new project.

2.  Add a new Data Source as part of your new project. The type and
    structure of the data source should be similar to what we outlined
    above.

3.  Add the Location Analyzer component from the VBX Maps to your
    project.

4.  Assign the data source to the map component.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Location Analyzer
    Component. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please
    use the menu View **•** Additional Properties to activate the
    display of the properties\ **.**

6.  Navigate to the category Data and subcategory Source Data.

7.  Set the option Source Data Type to the value Latitude / Longitude.

8.  Assign the dimension to the property Latitude.

9.  Assign the dimension to the property Longitude.

10. Navigate to the area Map Layers.

11. Navigate to the subcategory Bubble Layer.

12. Enable the option Activate Bubble Layer.

13. Click Create Layer (see Figure 8.55).

.. figure:: _static/images/m55.jpg
	:align: center
Figure 8.55: Bubble Map Layer 
14. Enter a Layer Name.

15. Select a measure for the Primary Measure (Bubble Size).

16. Select a measure for the Secondary Measure (Bubble Color). The
    secondary measure is optional.

17. In case you configured a Secondary Measure, you will also have the
    option to setup a color scheme.

18. In addition you can configure define filter values based on the
    assigned data source that are specific for this map layer.

19. Click Add / Update and the map Layer should be shown as part of the
    map.

How to use the Location Analyzer – Flow Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following steps we will use the Location Analyzer component and
setup a Flow Layer Map. For the Flow Layer map we require a data source
with two sets of Longitude and Latitude values – one set for the origin
and one set for the destination. For our example we will assume, that
the data source contains the following elements:

-  Dimension Origin City Longitude in the Rows.

-  Dimension Origin City Latitude in the Rows.

-  Dimension Destination City Longitude in the Rows.

-  Dimension Destination City Latitude in the Rows.

-  Measure Revenue in the Columns.

You can follow the steps below to setup a new Location Analyzer
Component:

1.  In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer create a
    new project.

2.  Add a new Data Source as part of your new project. The type and
    structure of the data source should be similar to what we outlined
    above.

3.  Add the Location Analyzer component from the VBX Maps to your
    project.

4.  Assign the data source to the map component.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Location Analyzer
    Component. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please
    use the menu View **•** Additional Properties to activate the
    display of the properties\ **.**

6.  Navigate to the category Data and subcategory Source Data.

7.  Set the option Source Data Type to the value Latitude / Longitude.

16. Set the dimension for the Source and Destination Longitude and
    Latitude properties according to the data source.

17. Assign the measure to the Primary Measure (Color).

18. Configure the color scheme to be a sequential color scheme.

19. Assign the second measure to the property for the Secondary Measure
    (Weight).

20. Configure the Size for the Secondary Measure to be a fixed size
    between 5 and 10 px.

21. Click Save.

22. Execute the application locally.

How to use the Location Analyzer – Conditional Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Location Analyzer component is also support Conditional Formatting
for the Choropleth Map layer as well as the Marker Layer. In the next
set of steps we will use the choropleth layer that we created in the
previous steps to outline the steps to activate the conditional
formatting.

You can follow the steps below to setup Conditional Formatting:

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer open the
   project from our previously created choropleth layer.

2. Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Location Analyzer
   Component. In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please
   use the menu View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display
   of the properties\ **.**

3. Navigate to the category Data.

4. Navigate to the subcategory Conditional Formatting.

5. Click Create Rule (see Figure 8.58).

6.  Enter a Rule Name.

7.  Select one of the available map layers. You can choose map layer of
    type Choropleth and Marker.

8.  You have three different rule types: Single Measure, Measure
    Calculation, and Target Value. You can find the details on these
    different rule types in section 4.3.10 as part of the section for
    Conditional Formatting for charts.

9.  Select the option Single Measure.

10. You can then choose a measure that will be compared against another
    value. For our example we will use measure Revenue as Comparison
    Measure.

11. For the option operator we use Greater Than.

12. For the Comparison Value Type we will use the option Dynamic.

13. For the Dynamic Selection Value we will set the value Measure
    Selection.

14. We will then use the measure Forecast for the Comparison Value.

15. And we will then set a color for the rule.

16. Click on Add / Update to add the Rule to our map.

Based on this rule, the measure Revenue will be compared against measure
Forecast for all the entries in your data source that are part of the
choropleth layer and in case the condition is met, the geographic area
will then be filled with the selected color.

Additional Properties of Location Analyzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a custom component the Location Analyzer also comes with a set of
Additional Properties. In the following sections you will find a list of
available properties and a Table with a more detailed description of
each of those properties.
